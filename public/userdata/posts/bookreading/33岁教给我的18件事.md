title: 33岁教给我的18件事
------------------------------------
<!-- zh-CN:+ -->
> 不紧不慢就是最好的生活；做好自己就是一条路径。写给自己的33岁。

1. 你有很多朋友，这可能是个假象。你可能只有亲人。
2. 趁父母还能走得动的时候，尽早单独带他们出去旅行。这句话的意思是说，如果你已组建了家庭，那么有必要抽出一到两次机会不带家室而是带着父母去旅行。
3. 你与朋友的关系还不错，实际上只有一个原因，那就是没有利益冲突。
4. 市面上有很多讲建立人脉的书籍和方法，几乎都是纸上谈兵的冷笑话。你在打量别人的时候，别人也在打量你。建立人脉几乎只有一个方法，那就是提高自己的段位。实际上，人脉并没有什么用，唯一有用的是你有用。
5. 花时间比花钱的情谊，更值得我们珍重。永远都不要去测试感情，就如同永远都不要去测试人性。
6. 工作，带给我们物质保障的同时，也会让我们不知不觉养成某种习惯。有很多人钱没怎么赚到，倒是被工作（公司）惯出了一大堆坏毛病。一个人一生可能要经历两三份工作，这样看来，习惯显然要比目前你拿到多少薪水更重要。
7. 兼职是伪努力，除了增加一时的账面收入，还能获得什么呢？很可能账面收入也并没有增加多少。
8. 自律，就是捷径。
9. 要过得足够好。至少，要让父母感觉到你过得足够好。这会避免让他们没完没了的各种担心。
10. 运动和阅读是最低成本最直接有效地投资自己的两种方式。
11. 这几个能力，会让我们过得好：取悦自己让自己的心情变好、懂得说不、直截了当简明扼要地表达自己的诉求和想法、独处。
12. 对事对人，都不要心存侥幸。
13. 当你原谅一个人的时候，就不要再提起这件事了。
14. 控制住说废话说蠢话的欲望，和在感觉吃饱之前主动放下筷子的意义是一样的，都是一种自爱。
15. 太过在意别人的看法，可惜别人并不对你的人生负责任。其结果无非就是活成了别人嘴里的笑料。
16. 没有什么事是放不下的，除非不够忙。
17. 克制住对别人的讨好、谄媚甚至厌恶。仍有善心，只不过是会善用善心。
18. 去爱，但不要相信为爱而生。

1. You have many friends. This may be an illusion. You may only have relatives.
2. Take the parents out alone as soon as possible when they can still walk. The meaning of this sentence is that if you have already started a family, then it is necessary to take one or two opportunities to travel with your parents instead of the family.
3. Your relationship with your friends is pretty good. There is actually only one reason, that is, there is no conflict of interest.
4. There are a lot of books and methods on building contacts on the market, almost all of them are cold jokes on paper. When you are looking at others, they are also looking at you. There is almost only one way to establish contacts, and that is to improve your rank. In fact, contacts are useless, the only thing that is useful is that you are useful.
5. The friendship that spends time is more worthy of our treasure. Never test feelings, just like never test human nature.
6. While work brings us material security, it also allows us to develop a certain habit without knowing it. There are many people who don't make much money, but they are used to a lot of bad things by their work (company). A person may have to go through two or three jobs in his life, so it seems that habits are obviously more important than how much salary you get.
7. Part-time job is a pseudo-effort. What else can you get besides increasing your book income for a while? It is likely that the book income has not increased much.
8. Self-discipline is a shortcut.
9. Have a good enough life. At least, let your parents feel that you are well enough. This will avoid the endless worries that make them endless.
10. Exercise and reading are the two most direct and effective ways to invest in yourself at the lowest cost.
11. These abilities will make us have a good life: please ourselves to make ourselves feel better, know how to say no, express our desires and thoughts straightforwardly and concisely, and be alone.
12. Don't let things happen to people.
13. When you forgive someone, stop mentioning it again.
14. Controlling the desire to talk nonsense and stupid things is the same as taking the initiative to let go of chopsticks before feeling full. It is a kind of self-love.
15. Too much care about the opinions of others, but unfortunately others are not responsible for your life. The result is nothing more than being a joke in others' mouths.
16. There is nothing you can't let go, unless you are not busy enough.
17. Restrain from pleasing, flattering and even disgusting others. There is still kindness, but it is good to use kindness.
18. To love, but don't believe in being born for love.
