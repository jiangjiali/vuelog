title: 外汇储备规模与管理
------------------------------------
<!-- zh-CN:+ -->

## 保持一定规模的外汇储备是调节外汇收支和市场总供求的重要手段。但是外汇储备并非越多越好。原因如下：

* 1、外汇储备增加，要相应扩大货币供给量，会增加对市场均衡的压力；

* 2、外汇储备表现为持有一种以外币表示的金融债权，相应资金存在国外，并未投入国内生产使用。外汇储备过大，等于相应的资金“溢出”；

* 3、外汇储备还可能由于外币汇率贬低而蒙受损失。

适度的外汇储备水平，取决于经济发展的规模和速度、对外开放的程度、以及国家影响国际收支的有效程度等诸多因素。有一种说法，认为维持相当于本国3-4个月的进口额的外汇储备水平是适度的。这类指标只有有限的参考价值。

我国正处于经济体制转轨过程，存在较多的不确定因素，面对的国际政治、经济、金融形势又极为复杂。为了保证国际收支的平衡，维持汇率水平的稳定，就要求必须持有较为雄厚的外汇储备。

## 在国际金融动荡的情况下，外汇储备的管理：

* 1、要考虑资金安全；

* 2、要考虑保持流动性，即保证储备资产能够灵活兑现，以备随时运用；

* 3、在保证安全性和流动性的前提下，根据资产多样化的原则，应把一部分资产投资于稳定成长的证券上，以获取收益。

## Maintaining a certain scale of foreign exchange reserves is an important means to regulate foreign exchange receipts and payments and the total market supply and demand. But foreign exchange reserves are not as much as possible. The reasons are as follows:

* 1. As foreign exchange reserves increase, the money supply must be expanded accordingly, which will increase the pressure on market equilibrium;

* 2. Foreign exchange reserves are represented by holding a financial claim expressed in a foreign currency, and the corresponding funds are stored abroad and have not been used for domestic production. Excessive foreign exchange reserves are equivalent to "overflow" of corresponding funds;

* 3. Foreign exchange reserves may also suffer losses due to depreciation of foreign currency exchange rates.

The appropriate level of foreign exchange reserves depends on many factors such as the scale and speed of economic development, the degree of opening to the outside world, and the effectiveness of the country’s influence on the international balance of payments. There is a saying that maintaining a level of foreign exchange reserves equivalent to 3-4 months' worth of imports is appropriate. Such indicators have limited reference value.

my country is in the process of economic system transition, there are many uncertain factors, and the international political, economic, and financial situation it faces is extremely complicated. In order to ensure the balance of international payments and maintain the stability of the exchange rate level, it is necessary to hold relatively strong foreign exchange reserves.

## In the context of international financial turmoil, the management of foreign exchange reserves:

* 1. The safety of funds must be considered;

* 2. It is necessary to consider maintaining liquidity, that is, to ensure that the reserve assets can be cashed flexibly for use at any time;

* 3. Under the premise of ensuring safety and liquidity, according to the principle of asset diversification, part of the assets should be invested in stable growth securities to obtain income.
