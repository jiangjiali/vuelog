## 一、什么是系统思维？
一般系统论创始人贝塔朗菲认为，**系统是由相互联系、相互作用的若干要素组成的表现为新功能的有机整体**。系统并不仅仅是一些事物的简单集合，而是一个由一组相互连接的要素构成的、能够实现某个目标的整体。任何一个系统都包括三种构成要件：**要素、连接、功能或目标。**

![](userdata/images/10006812-1.jpg)

例如：你的消化系统包括牙齿、酶、胃、肠等要素，它们通过身体血液的流动和一系列化学反应产生相互的连接；消化系统的功能是将食物转化为人体所需的基本营养成分，并将这些营养成分输送到血流中（另一个系统），同时通过新陈代谢，排出各种废物。

再如：一支足球队是一个系统，它的要素包括球员、教练、场地和足球等；它们之间通过游戏规则、教练指导、球员技能、球员之间的交流以及物理法则等产生连接；而球队的目标是赢球、娱乐、锻炼或赚钱等。

同样：一所学校、一座城市、一家工厂、一个公司以及国家经济等，都是系统。动物是一个系统，树也是一个系统，而森林则是一个更大的系统，包含了很多树木和动物等这些子系统。地球是一个系统，太阳系、银河系都是系统，包含了地球和其他很多子系统。

工程控制论的奠基人钱学森认为，系统按其组成成分和数量、结构复杂程度，系统可分为简单系统和复杂系统，复杂系统中可分为简单巨系统、复杂巨系统、开放复杂巨系统。

简单系统是指组成系统的子系统数量比较少，它们之间关系自然比较单纯。如一台测量仪器，这就是小系统。如果子系统数量相对较多（如几十、上百），如一个工厂，则可称作大系统。

若子系统数量非常大（如成千上万、上百亿、万亿），则称作巨系统。若巨系统中子系统种类不太多（几种、几十种），且它们之间关联关系又比较简单，就称作简单巨系统，如激光系统。

如果子系统种类很多并有层次结构，它们之间关联关系又很复杂，这就是复杂巨系统。如果这个系统又是开放的，就称作开放的复杂巨系统。

例如：生物体系统、人脑系统、人体系统、地理系统（包括生态系统）、社会系统、星系系统等。这些系统无论在结构、功能、行为和演化方面，都很复杂，如人脑系统，由于人脑的记忆、思维和推理功能以及意识作用，它的输人一输出反应特性极为复杂。

![](userdata/images/10006812-2.jpg)

### 系统的三个基本特征：
1、系统是由若干元素（要素）组成，这些要素可能是单个事物，也可能是一群事物组成的子系统；

2、这些元素（要素）之间存在着相互作用、互相依赖的有机联系，这是系统与一群彼此无关的事物组合（“堆”）的重要区别；

3、由于元素（要素）之间的相互作用，使系统作为一个整体具有特定的功能。这种功能是由系统内部各要素间的有机联系和它的结构所确定的、与各组成要素的功能不同的新功能。

贝塔朗菲强调，任何系统都是一个有机的整体，它不是各个部分的机械组合或简单相加，系统的整体功能是各要素在孤立状态下所没有的性质。**系统中各要素不是孤立地存在着，每个要素在系统中都处于一定的位置上，起着特定的作用。**要素之间相互关联，构成了一个不可分割的整体。

所谓思维方式是指一个时代人们认识和研究事物的方法和手段的总和，是一种支配人们思考与行动的规范、标准和格式。而**系统思维是根据系统概念、系统的性质、关系、结构、把对象有机地组织起来构成模型，研究系统的功能和行为，着重从整体上去揭示系统内部各要素之间以及系统与外部环境间的多种多样的联系、关系、结构与功能。**它是以系统观为基础，以研究复杂性为主要任务的一种现代思维方式。

### 系统思维可以帮助我们克服以下五种典型症状：
只见树木，不见森林；  
只看眼前，不看长远；  
只看现象，不见本质；  
头痛医头，脚痛医脚；  
本位主义，局限思考。

## 二、系统的８大基本原理

系统论的基本思想方法，就是把所研究和处理的对象，当作一个系统，分析系统的结构和功能，研究系统、要素、环境三者的相互关系和变动的规律性，并优化系统的观点看问题。系统论认为系统一般具备八大原理：**整体性原理、层次性原理、开放性原理、目的性原理、突变性原理、稳定性原理、自组织原理、相似性原理。**

![](userdata/images/10006812-3.jpg)

### 1、系统的整体性原理
系统整体性原理指的是，系统是由若干要素组成的具有一定新功能的有机整体，各个作为系统子单元的要素一旦组成系统整体，就具有独立要素所不具有的性质和功能，形成了新的系统的质的规定性，从而表现出整体的性质和功能不等于各个要素的性质和功能的简单相加。要素是整体中的要素，如果将要素从系统整体中割离出来，它将失去要素的作用。

例如：人体就不是各个器官的简单相加。人手是人体的劳动器官，一旦将手从人体中砍下来，那它将不再是劳动器官。

### 2、系统层次性原理
系统的层次性犹如套箱。系统是由要素组成的。高层次系统是由低层次系统构成的，高层次包含着低层次，低层次属于高层次。高层次和低层次之间的关系，首先是一种整体和部分，系统和要素之间的关系。

例如人体由器官组成，各个器官统一受到制约。但与此同时，各个器官又有自己的独立性，在发挥自己的功能时，有着一定的独立性。一个系统，如果没有整体性，这个系统也就崩溃了，不复存在了。系统的层次区分是相对的，系统上下层次之间受到相互影响，相互制约，而且是多个层次之间发生着相互联系，相互作用，有时甚至是多个层次之间的协同作用。系统发生自组织时，系统中出现了众多要素，多个不同的部分，多个层次的相干行为，它们一下子全都被动员起来，使得涨落得以响应，得以放大，造成整个系统发生相变，进入新的状态。

### 3、系统开放性原理
系统的开放性原理指的是：系统具有不断地与外界环境进行物质、能量、信息交换的性质和功能，系统向环境开放是系统得以向上发展的前提，也是系统得以稳定存在的条件。

系统的开放，包含向环境开放和向内部开放。系统向高层开放，便得系统可以与环境发生相互作用，可以发生与环境之间的既竞争又合作。而系统向低层开放，使得系统内部可能发生多层次的，多水平的，在差异之中协同作用，更好地发挥系统的整体性功能。

例如：中国的改革开放，不仅向外部开放，也向内部开发，大家都可以参与到经济建设中，公平竞争，协同发展。

### 4、系统的目的性原理
系统目的性原理指的是，组织系统在与环境的相互作用中，坚持表现出某种趋向预先确定的状态的特性。

例如企业系统具有明确的目的性，每个企业组合成的经济系统，也具有明确的目的性。由于系统是开放的，通过系统与环境的物质，能量和信息的交换，使得系统受到环境的影响，从而该系统得以影响环境，并在一定意义上识别环境即针对环境的实际情况作出反应、作出调整、作出选择，使自己潜在的发展能力得以表现出来。

### 5、系统突变性原理
系统突变性原理指的是，系统通过失稳，从一种状态进入另一种状态是一种突变过程，它是系统质变的一种基本形式，突变方式多种多样，同时系统发展还存在着分岔，从而有了质变的多样性，带来系统发展的丰富多彩。

系统状态发生改变，在系统科学中也称为 “相变”，这是系统的质变。相变有平衡相变和非平衡相变之分。平衡相变形成的新结构是一种死结构。（如结晶），而非平衡相变形成的结构只能在开放系统条件下依靠物质和能量的耗散来维持其稳定性，即在演化发展中维持其稳定性，是一种活结构。系统自组织演化的相变当然也只能是非平衡相变。从无序到有序，从一种耗散结构到另一种耗散结构，从低及循环到高级循环，从一种有序态到另一种有序态，从一种混沌态到另一种混沌态，都是非平衡相变。

生物学中所谓的基因突变就是在系统的要素的层次上来谈论突变的。对于系统要素的突变，如果从系统整体上看，就可以被看作系统之中的涨落。系统中要素的平衡是相对的，不平衡才是绝对的。系统中要素的突变总是时常发生的，突变成为系统中的发展过程中的非平衡性因素，是稳定之中的不稳定，不稳定得到整个系统的响应时，涨落放大，整体系统一起地动起来，系统发生质变，进入新的状态。这就是自组织理论的一个重要结论：通过涨落达到有序。

### 6、系统稳定性原理
系统稳定性原理指的是，在外界作用下开放系统具有一定的自我稳定能力，能够有一定范围内自我调节，从而保持和恢复原来的有序状态，保持和恢复原有的结构和功能。

静止即稳定，平衡即稳定，这是一种机械论的观点，有其片面性。它是以牺牲系统自我运动和自我发展能力为代价的稳定性。而系统的稳定性是系统在发展和演化之中的稳定性。系统的稳定性，首先是一种开放中的稳定性。开放是系统发展变化的前提，也是 “活” 系统得以保持系统稳定的前提。这同时也意味着系统的稳定性都是动态中的稳定性。耗散结构理论之所以把自己叫做耗散结构，就是强调系统的稳定性是在与环境的动态的交换之中才得以保持的。

自组织系统，总是处于演化之中的，无论它是物理化学系统，还是生物系统以至社会系统。**所谓的系统的稳定性，决非绝对意义上的稳定性。任何时候，任何条件下，系统之中总是存在涨落的，这就已经表明系统的稳定性总是不完全的，总是在稳定之中存在着不稳定的。**事实上，很多时候，即使系统在整体上是稳定的，系统之中也可能存在局部的不稳定性。而且，正是因为系统中存在不稳定的因素，这种最初是个别的，局部的不稳定的因素，在一定条件下得以放大，超出了系统在原先条件下保持自身稳定的条件，系统保持自身稳定的能力遭到破坏，才使得系统整体上失稳，从而进入新的稳定态。由此看来，系统中的不稳定因素，反而成为系统演化发展的积极因素。

### 7、系统自组织原理
自组织原理是指系统不存在外部指令，系统按照相互默契的某种规则，各尽其责而又协调地、自动地形成有序结构，就是自组织。自组织系统无需外界指令而能自行组织、自行创生、自行演化，即能自主地从无序走向有序。在复杂系统中只有这种自组织结构才能够真正做到有序，而那种依靠外界的力量来直接控制复杂系统的方式是一种无序结构。一个最典型的例子是，我们的计划经济体系，表面上看来非常有序，一切都按我们人为的计划运行。而实际上我们越计划，社会越乱，以至于最后不得不解体。而市场经济，我们几乎不需要宏观计划，而只需要保障经济体系中各个组织健康发展的条件，整个体系就会自动的形成有序运动。

充分开放是系统自组织演化的前提条件，非线性相互作用是自组织系统演化的内在动力，涨落成为系统自组织演化的原初诱因，循环是系统自组织演化的组织形式，相变和分形体现了系统自组织演化方式的多样性，混沌和分形揭示了从简单到复杂的系统自组织演化的图景。通过涨落达到有序，这是系统自组织理论中的一个重要的基本结论。

### 8、系统相似性原理
系统的相似性原理指的是，系统具有同构和同态的性质，体现在系统的结构和功能，存在方式和演化过程具有共同性，这是一种有差异的共性，是系统统一性的一种表现。例如：股票系统和生态系统和人体系统具备相似性，都具备混沌性、分形、自组织、突变等特征。

系统具有某种相似性，是种种系统理论得以建立的基础。如果没有系统的相似性就没有具有普遍性的系统理论。系统具有相似性，最根本原因在于世界的物质统一性。系统的相似性，不仅仅是指系统存在方式的相似性，也指系统演化方式的相似性。系统演化的全过程——大圆圈，也体现从混沌到有序，再从有序到混沌的相似性。系统演化的每一相对完整的阶段——小圆圈，从一种有序到另一种有序的发展，也表现相似性。

以上就是系统的８大原理，只有对系统的原理有了深刻的认知，才能真正的理解系统，才能站在系统的角度去思考问题。

## 三、系统思维工具
人类为了更好的理解和认识系统，也为了解决系统问题，发展出一系列的系统思维分析工具，最为著名工具包含：系统动力学和系统循环图等。系统动力学是一门分析研究信息反馈系统的学科，也是一门认识系统问题和解决系统问题的综合性交叉学科。它是系统科学与管理科学的－一个分支，也是一门沟通自然科学和社会科学等领域的横向学科。由于系统动力学采用了计算机模拟仿真系统的运行原理，所以具有很强的实用性，常见的软件有，Ithink 和 vensim 等。由于涉及到计算机建模，由于篇幅有限，这里不多做赘述，大家可以上网搜索学习。下面着重和大家分享简单实用的系统思维工具——系统循环图。

### 系统循环图的五大元素
系统循环图也被称为因果回路图，可以帮助你以因果关系链的形式来描述系统。绘制系统循环图由以下五种元素构成：连接、反馈回路、悬摆、时滞、箭头。

![](userdata/images/10006812-4.jpg)

#### 元素1、连接
系统只有两种连接：同向（+）、反向（-）。换言之，所有的连接不是同向连接，就是反向连接，除此之外没有其他的类型。

同向连接：S 型连接 “+”，因果关系同向增强变化的连接。变量 A 的变化会影响到变量 B，而且二者之间的变化是同向的。例如，销售会影响收入。销售越多，收入越多；销售越少，收入越少。

反向连接：O 型连接 “-”，因果关系反向制约变化的连接。变量 A 的变化会影响到变量 B，而且二者之间的变化方向是相反的。例如，成本会影响利润。成本越大，利润越少；成本越低，利润越高。

#### 元素2、反馈回路
反馈回路就是保障任何系统运行的必要条件，人是世界最复杂的系统，大脑通过反馈回路指挥着整个身体的运行。比如像倒杯咖啡或茶这种看起来似乎非常简单、我们每天都不假思索地做了无数次的工作，也和反馈回路有关系。如果离开了反馈回路，即使是这种简单的工作都无法完成。

不信的话，你可以试着蒙上眼睛倒杯茶看看。在这个例子中，反馈回路的关键点就在于，在你向杯中倒水的同时，你通过观察杯中的水位而获取反馈信息。当你看着水位上升的时候，反馈通过你的大脑和眼睛发挥作用，让你在杯子将满时停止倒水。这个系统由你手所处的位置、你倒水的速率、咖啡杯中的水位、你的眼睛对杯中水位的观察，以及你的大脑到你的信号构成，共同组成一个反馈回路。如果你破坏了这个回路——比如蒙住眼睛，从而无法观察杯中水位是如何上升的，你就会不断地加水，直到杯中水溢出，系统产生了故障。

反馈回路分为增强回路（正反馈）和调节回路（负反馈）。

增强回路：在一个反馈回路中，每一个循环都使得系统效能持续增强的回路称为增强回路；加速成长或衰减，我们通常称之为良性循环和恶性循环。

![](userdata/images/10006812-5.jpg)

调节回路：稳定与目标或限制条件，可以理解为某一个平衡状态。在一个反馈回路中，每一次循环都是使得系统进一步逼近某一个设定的目标值，这样的回路称为调节回路，也称为负反馈回路；

![](userdata/images/10006812-6.jpg)

例如：我们倒咖啡时目标是倒半杯，在我们向杯子中倒咖啡的时候，我们的眼睛一直在关注杯中水位的上升，无论何时，我们都在评价 “目标水位和实际水位的差距”。正是我们心中的这种评价促使我们对我们的 “肢体动作＂进行控制（在本例中就是手的位置），进而决定了我们将咖啡倒人杯中的速率。起初的时候，目标水位和实际水位之间的差距相对很大（当杯子中只有一点点咖啡的时候），我们的肢体动作就是相对较快地倒水，就是说，这是一一个 S 型连接。

当然，我们的肢体动作会影响到 “杯中咖啡水位”，就像我们的“肢体动作” 越大，“杯中咖啡水位”就越高，因此这也应该是一个 S 型连接。但是，随着 “杯中咖啡水位” 逐渐上升，“目标水位和实际水位的差距”逐渐下降，因此这是一个 O 型连接。随着杯中目标水位和实际水位的差距逐渐变小，我们的 “肢体动作” 就变得越来越柔和，“杯中咖啡水位”就上升得越慢，直到 “目标水位和实际水位的差距” 变为零，到了这个时候，我们就会停止我们的“肢体动作”，而杯中咖啡也在我们目标的导引下达到了半满的水位。

这个环的作用就是控制 “杯中咖啡水位” 使其逐渐达到“　咖啡目标水位”，当目标达到时，我们就会停止“肢体动作”。

#### 元素3、悬摆

有些系统循环图在闭环之外还有一些因素，比如前面的 “咖啡目标水位”，这类因素称之为 “悬摆”。悬摆分为两类：

输入悬摆：外部环境向系统内部注入外部能量的悬摆；例如希望达到的目标等。

输出悬摆：系统向外部环境输出系统运行结果的悬摆；一般表示系统运行的结果。

#### 元素4、时滞
输入激励与输出结果之间存在的时间迟滞；例如：培训不会马上带来业绩的提升，中间会有时滞。

#### 元素5、箭头
反映相互连接的二个事件之间的因果变化方向的指示；

大家可以运用以上五大元素绘制系统循环图，找寻各种因果关系，更好的认识和理解系统。下面是一个员工管理方面的系统循环图：

![](userdata/images/10006812-7.jpg)

### 绘制系统循环图的12条法则
法则 1：了解问题的边界，通常通过 “悬摆” 来定义我们所感兴趣的系统的外部边界－悬摆扮演着目标、政策、外部驱动力或者系统结果的角色。

法则 2：从 “有趣” 的地方开始－可以是最关键的外部驱动力，也可以是最重要的成果，也可以是与解决问题相关的最重要因素开始。

法则 3：询问 “它将驱动什么” 以及“它的驱动力是什么”（如何确定下一步、上一步）

法则 4：不要陷入混乱。下一步或者上一步应该是最直接的原因／后果，而不能继续归根究底，不然所有元素都会混乱的交织在一起。

法则 5：不要使用动词，请使用名词。例如使用服务质量，而不是提供高质量的服务。

法则 6：不要使用类似于 “在 ··· 方面增长／降低” 这样的名词。用这种表述潜意识就是默认了这种因果关系只有单向的。

法则 7：不要害怕从未出现过的项目。一切用事实说话。

法则 8：随着发展及时确定连接类型。每走一步、立刻确定好连接类型，因为在确定连接类型时就是一次深度思考；及时确定连接类型有利于准确把握系统的回路特征。

法则 9：坚持就是胜利，继续前进吧。

法则 10：好图表必须反映实况。每个人画出的系统循环图都只是反映了他看待这个系统的观点。一开始由于每个人思考问题的角度和思维模式是不一样的，可能会得到几个不同版本的系统循环图，但应该尽可能的反复讨论，最终得到一个群体中每个人都认可的统一结论。

法则 11：不要爱上你的图标。听取更合理的建议，接受需要图表仍改动的事实。

法则 12：没有 “已经” 完成的图表。真实世界非常复杂，任何系统循环图，无论其包含多少元素，都会忽略一些元素，所以没有完美的系统循环图，是需要不断进行改进的。

### 系统循环图的价值
**深入思考**  
系统循环图以变量和连接两种要素来表述系统的结构，完全符合系统的定义（由相互连接的实体构成的整体），能有效地表述系统的特性（例如总体大于部分之和、因果互动、反馈、结构影响行为等），而且按照理解世界的 “冰山模型”，它有助于人们看到系统行为背后的驱动力及其相互关系，可以深化人们的思考层次。

**动态思考**  
系统循环图以特定符号（“＋”/“－”）来表述连接的方向，并可以很方便地通过识别反向连接（“－”）数量的方式来确定回路的行为特性，因此可以说在静止的平面图形上巧妙地 “呈现” 了系统的动态，使得大家可以实现动态、环型思考。

**全面思考**  
在实践中，由于系统循环图可以将利益相关者的观点整合起来，并显示出关联方之间的互动关系和关键因素，有助于人们突破局限思考，实现全面思考。

## 总结
世界是复杂的，世界是混沌的，世界是分形的，世界是不确定的，世界是无数大小系统的集合，我们每个人都是一个系统，同时被不同的系统包围着，例如宇宙系统、生命系统、精神系统、生态系统、社会系统。人类在认识世界和改造世界的过程中，必须对系统进行深刻的认知和理解，从整体上去探究本质，才能看的更清楚。每一个人每天都会遇到各种不同的问题，例如健康问题，家庭问题，人际问题、管理问题和社会问题，每一个问题都可能是系统问题，不仅仅是单个元素问题，如果我们头痛医头脚痛医脚，必然会陷入困境，只有从系统观的维度去思考，整体性研究，利用系统思维工具去找寻因果回路，进而找到问题症结，方能药到病除。

## 1. What is system thinking?
The founder of the general system theory, Beta Langfei, believes that the **system is an organic whole** composed of several interconnected and interacting elements that are expressed as new functions. The system is not just a simple collection of things, but a whole set of interconnected elements that can achieve a certain goal. Any system includes three elements: **element, connection, function or goal.**

![](userdata/images/10006812-1.jpg)

For example: Your digestive system includes teeth, enzymes, stomach, intestines and other elements, which are connected to each other through the flow of body blood and a series of chemical reactions; the function of the digestive system is to transform food into basic nutrients needed by the human body. And transport these nutrients into the bloodstream (another system), and at the same time excrete various waste products through metabolism.

Another example: a football team is a system, and its elements include players, coaches, courts, football, etc.; they are connected through game rules, coaching guidance, player skills, communication between players, and physical laws; and The goal of the team is to win, entertain, exercise or make money.

The same: a school, a city, a factory, a company, and the national economy are all systems. Animals are a system, trees are also a system, and forest is a larger system that contains many subsystems such as trees and animals. The earth is a system, the solar system and the Milky Way are systems, including the earth and many other subsystems.

Qian Xuesen, the founder of engineering cybernetics, believes that systems can be divided into simple systems and complex systems according to their composition, quantity, and structural complexity. Complex systems can be divided into simple giant systems, complex giant systems, and open complex giant systems.

A simple system means that the number of subsystems that make up the system is relatively small, and the relationship between them is naturally relatively simple. Like a measuring instrument, this is a small system. If the number of subsystems is relatively large (such as tens or hundreds), such as a factory, it can be called a large system.

If the number of subsystems is very large (such as thousands, tens of billions, trillions), it is called a giant system. If there are not too many types of subsystems in a giant system (several or dozens of types), and the relationship between them is relatively simple, it is called a simple giant system, such as a laser system.

If there are many types of subsystems and a hierarchical structure, and the relationship between them is very complicated, this is a complex giant system. If this system is open again, it is called an open complex giant system.

For example: biological system, human brain system, human body system, geographic system (including ecosystem), social system, galaxy system, etc. These systems are very complex in terms of structure, function, behavior, and evolution. For example, the human brain system has extremely complex input-output response characteristics due to the human brain's memory, thinking and reasoning functions, and consciousness.

![](userdata/images/10006812-2.jpg)

### Three basic characteristics of the system:
1. The system is composed of several elements (elements). These elements may be a single thing or a subsystem composed of a group of things;

2. There is an organic relationship between these elements (elements) that interact and depend on each other. This is an important difference between a system and a group of unrelated things ("heap");

3. Due to the interaction between the elements (elements), the system as a whole has a specific function. This function is a new function that is determined by the organic connection between the various elements in the system and its structure, and is different from the function of each component element.

Bertalanfi emphasized that any system is an organic whole, it is not a mechanical combination or simple addition of various parts. The overall function of the system is a property that each element does not have in an isolated state. **Each element in the system does not exist in isolation. Each element is in a certain position in the system and plays a specific role.** The elements are interrelated and form an indivisible whole.

The so-called way of thinking refers to the sum of the methods and means used by people in an era to recognize and study things, and is a norm, standard and format that governs people's thinking and actions. The **system thinking is based on the concept of the system, the nature of the system, the relationship, the structure, the organic organization of the objects to form a model, the study of the function and behavior of the system, and the focus on revealing the internal elements of the system as well as the system and the external environment. The diverse connections, relationships, structures and functions between the** It is a modern way of thinking based on the system view and the main task of studying complexity.

### System thinking can help us overcome the following five typical symptoms:
See the trees, but not the forest;  
Just look at the present, not the long-term;  
Just look at the phenomenon without seeing the essence;  
If you have a headache, you can heal your head;  
Standardism, limited thinking.

## Two, the 8 basic principles of the system
The basic thinking method of system theory is to treat the object of research and processing as a system, analyze the structure and function of the system, study the relationship between the system, the elements, and the environment and the regularity of changes, and optimize the system's viewpoint Look at the problem. System theory believes that systems generally have eight principles: the principle of integrity, the principle of hierarchy, the principle of openness, the principle of purpose, the principle of mutation, the principle of stability, the principle of self-organization, and the principle of similarity.

![](userdata/images/10006812-3.jpg)

### 1. The overall principle of the system
The principle of system integrity refers to the fact that a system is an organic whole composed of several elements and has certain new functions. Once each element as a subunit of the system composes the system as a whole, it has properties and functions that independent elements do not have, forming a new The qualitative stipulation of the system, thus showing that the overall nature and function is not equal to the simple addition of the nature and function of each element. The element is the element of the whole. If the element is separated from the system as a whole, it will lose the function of the element.

For example: the human body is not a simple addition of various organs. The human hand is the working organ of the human body. Once the hand is cut off from the human body, it will no longer be a working organ.

### 2. System hierarchy principle
The hierarchy of the system is like a box. The system is composed of elements. The high-level system is composed of the low-level system, the high-level contains the low-level, and the low-level belongs to the high-level. The relationship between high-level and low-level is, first of all, a relationship between whole and part, system and element.

For example, the human body is composed of organs, and each organ is uniformly restricted. But at the same time, each organ has its own independence, and has a certain degree of independence when performing its own functions. If a system does not have integrity, the system will collapse and cease to exist. The hierarchical distinction of the system is relative, the upper and lower levels of the system are affected and restricted by each other, and there are mutual connections, interactions, and sometimes even synergy between multiple levels. When the system self-organizes, there are many elements in the system, multiple different parts, multiple levels of related behaviors, all of them are mobilized at once, so that fluctuations can be responded to, amplified, and the entire system undergoes a phase change. Enter a new state.

### 3. Principles of system openness
The principle of openness of the system refers to the nature and function of the system to continuously exchange material, energy, and information with the external environment. The openness of the system to the environment is the prerequisite for the system to develop upward, and it is also the condition for the stable existence of the system.

The opening of the system includes opening to the environment and opening to the inside. When the system is open to the top, the system can interact with the environment, and it can compete and cooperate with the environment. The opening of the system to the lower level makes it possible to have multi-level and multi-level within the system, synergistically among the differences, and better play the overall function of the system.

For example: China's reform and opening up not only open to the outside, but also open to internal development. Everyone can participate in economic construction, fair competition and coordinated development.

### 4. Purpose principle of the system
The principle of system purpose refers to that the organizational system insists on showing a certain characteristic tending to a predetermined state in the interaction with the environment.

For example, the enterprise system has a clear purpose, and the economic system formed by each enterprise also has a clear purpose. Since the system is open, through the exchange of material, energy and information between the system and the environment, the system is affected by the environment, so that the system can affect the environment, and in a certain sense, the recognition of the environment means responding to the actual situation of the environment. Adjust and make choices so that your potential development ability can be displayed.

### 5. System mutation principle
The principle of system catastrophe refers to that the system goes from one state to another through instability is a catastrophic process. It is a basic form of system qualitative change. There are various mutation modes, and there are still system developments. Forking, there is a diversity of qualitative changes, which brings a variety of system development.

The state of the system changes, which is also called "phase transition" in system science, which is the qualitative change of the system. Phase changes are divided into balanced phase changes and non-equilibrium phase changes. The new structure formed by the equilibrium phase transition is a dead structure. (Such as crystallization), the structure formed by non-equilibrium phase transition can only maintain its stability by the dissipation of matter and energy under open system conditions, that is, maintain its stability during evolution and development, and it is a living structure. Of course, the phase transition of the system's self-organization evolution can only be a non-equilibrium phase transition. From disorder to order, from one dissipative structure to another, from low and cycle to high cycle, from one ordered state to another ordered state, from one chaotic state to another A chaotic state is an unbalanced phase transition.

The so-called gene mutation in biology talks about mutation at the level of system elements. Sudden changes in system elements can be seen as fluctuations in the system from the perspective of the system as a whole. The balance of the elements in the system is relative, and the imbalance is absolute. Sudden changes in the elements of the system always occur frequently. Sudden changes become an unbalanced factor in the development process of the system. They are unstable in stability. When the instability gets the response of the entire system, the fluctuations are amplified, and the entire system is affected together. When activated, the system undergoes a qualitative change and enters a new state. This is an important conclusion of the theory of self-organization: order through fluctuations.

### 6. System stability principle
The principle of system stability refers to the fact that an open system has certain self-stabilization ability under the influence of the outside world, and can self-regulate within a certain range, so as to maintain and restore the original orderly state, and maintain and restore the original structure and function.

Stillness means stability, and balance means stability. This is a mechanistic view, which is one-sided. It is stability at the expense of the system's self-movement and self-development ability. The stability of the system is the stability of the system in development and evolution. The stability of the system, first of all, is the stability in the open. Openness is a prerequisite for system development and change, and also a prerequisite for a "living" system to maintain system stability. This also means that the stability of the system is dynamic stability. The reason why the theory of dissipative structure calls itself a dissipative structure is to emphasize that the stability of the system can only be maintained in the dynamic exchange with the environment.

The self-organizing system is always evolving, whether it is a physical chemical system, a biological system or even a social system. **The so-called stability of the system is by no means stability in an absolute sense. At any time and under any conditions, there are always fluctuations in the system, which has shown that the stability of the system is always incomplete, and there is always instability in the stability.** In fact, in many cases, even if the system is stable as a whole, there may be local instability in the system. Moreover, it is precisely because there are unstable factors in the system. This initially individual and local unstable factor can be amplified under certain conditions. It exceeds the conditions for the system to maintain its own stability under the original conditions. The system maintains itself The ability to be stable is destroyed, and the system as a whole becomes unstable and enters a new stable state. From this point of view, the unstable factors in the system have become positive factors in the evolution and development of the system.

### 7, the principle of system self-organization
The principle of self-organization means that the system does not have external instructions, and the system, in accordance with a certain rule of mutual understanding, performs its own duties and forms an orderly structure in a coordinated and automatic manner, which is self-organization. The self-organizing system can organize, create and evolve by itself without external instructions, that is, it can autonomously move from disorder to order. Only this self-organizing structure can be truly orderly in a complex system, and the way to directly control the complex system by relying on external forces is a disordered structure. One of the most typical examples is that our planned economy system, on the surface, looks very orderly, and everything runs according to our artificial plan. In fact, the more we plan, the more chaotic society is, and we finally have to disintegrate. In the market economy, we hardly need macro planning, but only need to ensure the conditions for the healthy development of various organizations in the economic system, and the entire system will automatically form an orderly movement.

Full openness is a prerequisite for the self-organization and evolution of the system. Non-linear interaction is the internal driving force for the evolution of the self-organization system. Fluctuations become the original inducement for the self-organization and evolution of the system. The cycle is the organizational form of the self-organization and evolution of the system. Phase transition and fractal manifestation The diversification of the evolution of system self-organization, chaos and fractal reveal the picture of the self-organization evolution of systems from simple to complex. To achieve order through fluctuations is an important basic conclusion in the theory of system self-organization.

### 8. System similarity principle
The principle of system similarity refers to that the system has the properties of isomorphism and homomorphism, which is reflected in the structure and function of the system, and the existence mode and evolution process have commonality. This is a difference in commonality and system unity. A performance. For example, the stock system and the ecosystem are similar to the human body system, and they all have the characteristics of chaos, fractal, self-organization, and mutation.

The system has a certain similarity, which is the basis for the establishment of various system theories. If there is no system similarity, there is no universal system theory. The system is similar, the most fundamental reason lies in the material unity of the world. System similarity not only refers to the similarity of the way the system exists, but also the similarity of the way the system evolves. The whole process of system evolution, the big circle, also reflects the similarity from chaos to order, and then from order to chaos. Each relatively complete stage of the evolution of the system-the small circle, from one kind of order to another kind of orderly development, also shows similarities.

The above are the eight principles of the system. Only when you have a deep understanding of the principles of the system can you truly understand the system and think about problems from the perspective of the system.

## Three, system thinking tools
In order to better understand and understand the system, and to solve system problems, human beings have developed a series of system thinking analysis tools. The most famous tools include: system dynamics and system cycle diagrams. System dynamics is a discipline that analyzes and studies information feedback systems, and is also a comprehensive cross-discipline that recognizes and solves system problems. It is a branch of systems science and management science, and it is also a cross-discipline that communicates natural sciences and social sciences. Since the system dynamics adopts the operating principle of the computer simulation system, it has strong practicability. Common software includes Ithink and vensim. As it involves computer modeling and space is limited, I won’t go into details here. You can search and learn online. The following focuses on sharing with you a simple and practical system thinking tool-system cycle diagram.

### Five Elements of System Cycle Diagram
System cycle diagrams are also called causal loop diagrams, which can help you describe the system in the form of a chain of causality. Drawing a system cycle diagram consists of the following five elements: connection, feedback loop, pendulum, time lag, and arrow.

![](userdata/images/10006812-4.jpg)

#### Element 1, connection
The system has only two connections: same direction (+) and reverse (-). In other words, all connections are either in the same direction or in the reverse direction, and there is no other type.

Same direction connection: S-shaped connection "+", causal relationship strengthens the connection of change in the same direction. The change of variable A will affect variable B, and the changes between the two are in the same direction. For example, sales affect revenue. The more sales, the more revenue; the less sales, the less revenue.

Reverse connection: O-shaped connection "-", the connection in which causality restricts the change in reverse. The change of variable A will affect variable B, and the direction of change between the two is opposite. For example, costs can affect profits. The greater the cost, the less profit; the lower the cost, the higher the profit.

#### Element 2, feedback loop
The feedback loop is a necessary condition to ensure the operation of any system. Humans are the most complex system in the world, and the brain directs the operation of the entire body through the feedback loop. For example, pouring a cup of coffee or tea seems very simple. We do countless work without thinking about it every day, which is also related to the feedback loop. If you leave the feedback loop, even this simple task cannot be completed.

If you don’t believe it, you can try to pour a cup of tea blindfolded. In this example, the key point of the feedback loop is that while you pour water into the cup, you obtain feedback by observing the water level in the cup. When you watch the water level rise, feedback works through your brain and eyes, allowing you to stop pouring water when the glass is almost full. This system consists of the position of your hand, the rate at which you pour water, the water level in the coffee cup, the observation of the water level in the cup by your eyes, and the signal from your brain to you, which together form a feedback loop. If you break this circuit—for example, blindfolded so that you cannot observe how the water level in the cup rises, you will continue to add water until the water overflows in the cup, and the system malfunctions.

The feedback loop is divided into an enhancement loop (positive feedback) and a regulation loop (negative feedback).

Enhancement loop: In a feedback loop, the loop in which each cycle continuously enhances system performance is called the enhancement loop; accelerated growth or decay, we usually call it a virtuous circle and a vicious circle.

![](userdata/images/10006812-5.jpg)

Regulation loop: stability and target or restriction conditions can be understood as a certain equilibrium state. In a feedback loop, each cycle makes the system further approach a certain set target value. Such a loop is called a regulation loop, also called a negative feedback loop;

![](userdata/images/10006812-6.jpg)

For example: When we pour coffee, the goal is to pour half a cup. When we pour coffee into the cup, our eyes are always paying attention to the rise of the water level in the cup. At any time, we are evaluating "the difference between the target water level and the actual water level." ". It is this evaluation in our hearts that drives us to control our “body movements” (in this case, the position of the hands), which in turn determines the rate at which we pour coffee into the cup. At the beginning, the gap between the target water level and the actual water level was relatively large (when there was only a little coffee in the cup), our body movements were to pour water relatively quickly, that is, this is an S-shape connection.

Of course, our body movements will affect the "coffee water level in the cup", just as the larger our "body movements", the higher the "coffee water level in the cup", so this should also be an S-shaped connection. However, as the "coffee water level in the cup" gradually rises, the "difference between the target water level and the actual water level" gradually decreases, so this is an O-connection. As the gap between the target water level in the cup and the actual water level gradually decreases, our "body movements" become softer and softer, and the "coffee water level in the cup" rises more slowly until "the gap between the target water level and the actual water level" "Becomes zero. At this time, we will stop our "body movements", and the coffee in the cup has reached the half-full water level under the guidance of our target.

The function of this ring is to control the "coffee water level in the cup" to gradually reach the "coffee target water level". When the goal is reached, we will stop the "body movements".

#### Element 3, hanging pendulum
Some system cycle diagrams have some factors besides the closed loop, such as the “target coffee level” mentioned above. Such factors are called “hanging pendulum”. Pendulums are divided into two categories:

Input pendulum: A pendulum in which the external environment injects external energy into the system; for example, the desired goal.

Output pendulum: The pendulum that the system outputs the result of system operation to the external environment; generally represents the result of system operation.

#### Element 4, time lag
There is a time lag between input incentives and output results; for example: training will not immediately bring about performance improvement, there will be a time lag in the middle.

#### Element 5, Arrow
An indication that reflects the direction of causal change between two connected events;

You can use the above five elements to draw a system cycle diagram, find various causal relationships, and better understand and understand the system. The following is a system cycle diagram of employee management:

### 12 rules for drawing system cycle diagrams
Rule 1: Understand the boundary of the problem, usually through the "pendulum" to define the external boundary of the system we are interested in-the pendulum plays the role of goal, policy, external driving force or system result.

Rule 2: Start with the "interesting"-it can be the most critical external driving force, the most important result, or the most important factor related to problem solving.

Rule 3: Ask "what will it drive" and "what is its driving force" (how to determine the next step, the previous step)

Rule 4: Don't fall into chaos. The next step or the previous step should be the most direct cause/consequence, and cannot continue to the bottom line, otherwise all elements will be intertwined chaotically.

Rule 5: Don’t use verbs, use nouns. For example, use quality of service instead of providing high-quality service.

Rule 6: Don’t use terms like "increase/decrease in ···". Using this expression to subconsciously acquiesce that this causal relationship is only one-way.

Rule 7: Don’t be afraid of projects that have never appeared before. Everything speaks with facts.

Rule 8: Determine the connection type in time as it develops. Every step you take, immediately determine the connection type, because when determining the connection type is a deep thinking; determining the connection type in time is conducive to accurately grasp the loop characteristics of the system.

Rule 9: Persistence is victory, keep going.

Rule 10: A good chart must reflect the reality. Everyone's system cycle diagram just reflects his views on the system. In the beginning, because everyone's thinking angle and thinking mode are different, several different versions of the system cycle diagram may be obtained, but the discussion should be repeated as much as possible, and finally a unified conclusion recognized by everyone in a group.

Rule 11: Don't fall in love with your icon. Hear more reasonable suggestions and accept the fact that the diagram needs to be changed.

Rule 12: There is no "already" completed chart. The real world is very complicated. Any system cycle diagram, no matter how many elements it contains, will ignore some elements. Therefore, there is no perfect system cycle diagram, and it needs continuous improvement.

### The value of the system cycle diagram
**Think Deeply**  
The system cycle diagram expresses the structure of the system with two elements: variables and connections. It fully conforms to the definition of the system (a whole constituted by interconnected entities) and can effectively express the characteristics of the system (for example, the total is greater than the sum of parts, causal interaction, Feedback, structure affect behavior, etc.), and according to the "iceberg model" of understanding the world, it helps people see the driving forces behind the behavior of the system and their relationships, and can deepen people's thinking.

**Dynamic Thinking**  
The system cycle diagram uses specific symbols ("+"/"-") to express the direction of the connection, and can easily determine the behavior of the loop by identifying the number of reverse connections ("-"), so it can be said that The static plane graphics cleverly "present" the dynamics of the system, allowing everyone to realize dynamic and circular thinking.

**Thinking Around**  
In practice, because the system cycle diagram can integrate the views of stakeholders and show the interactive relationship and key factors between related parties, it helps people break through the limitations of thinking and realize comprehensive thinking.

## To Sum Up
The world is complex, the world is chaotic, the world is fractal, and the world is uncertain. The world is a collection of countless large and small systems. Each of us is a system and is surrounded by different systems at the same time, such as cosmic systems and life. System, mental system, ecological system, social system. In the process of recognizing and transforming the world, mankind must have a deep cognition and understanding of the system, and explore the essence as a whole, in order to see more clearly. Everyone encounters a variety of different problems every day, such as health problems, family problems, interpersonal problems, management problems and social problems. Every problem may be a system problem, not just a single element problem. If we have a headache Healing the feet with sore feet will inevitably fall into a predicament. Only by thinking from the perspective of the system, holistic research, using the tools of system thinking to find the cause and effect circuit, and then find the crux of the problem, can the cure be cured.
