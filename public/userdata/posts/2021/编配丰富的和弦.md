title: 怎么编配出丰富的和弦
------------------------------------
<!-- zh-CN:+ -->
## 1.调式互换的和弦代替：
这里的调式互换也就是指平行大小调的顺阶和弦互相借用。  
如:C大调与C小调的顺阶七和弦，只要替换的和弦与旋律不衝突，都可以代替。

举列：Fmaj7-Cmaj7-Ebmaj7-G7（即是跟小调借三级和弦）。

## 2.副属七和弦：
与新增ii-v的观念类似，都是在和弦前加一个往上五度的属和弦，只是新增ii-v可以对任何和弦，而副属七和弦是指顺阶和弦的属七和弦。  
如：A7、b7、C7、D7、E7為C大调顺阶和弦Dm7、Em7、Fmaj7、G7、Am7副属七和弦。
 
## 3.相同音的和弦代替：
两个和弦之间，若有两个以上的相同音，就可以互相替换。

如：C大调中:
- 主和弦功能的 Cmaj7 因為与 Am7、Em7 有三个相同音，即可以互替。
- 属和弦功能的 G7 因為与 bm7b5 三个相同音，即可以互替。
- 下属和弦功能的 Fmaj7 因為与 Dm7 有三个相同音，即可以互替。

(G7為顺阶和弦、F#7根音不在调性上，即不算副属七和弦)  
例如：C小调中:主和弦功能的 Cm7 因為与 Ebmaj7、Abmaj7 、Am7b5 有三个相同音，故可以互替。

- 下属和弦功能的 Fm7因為与 Dm7b5 、Abmaj7 有三个相同音，故可以互替。
- 属和弦功能的 G7 因為与 bDim7 有三个共同音，故可以互替。

## 4.加引伸音或变化引伸音：
其实没有替换和弦，只是在原和弦上增加引伸音色彩。好的引伸音或变化引伸音，只要不与原旋律衝突，常比替换掉原有和弦更好听。

大和弦可以增加9音、#11音、13音，或改為六和弦。如：C 改為 C6 。

小和弦可以增加9音、11音、13音，或改為小大七和弦。如：Cm 改為 Cm(maj7)。

属七和弦在和声上最不稳定，可以增加引伸音外，还可增加变化引伸音。

可增加9音、b9音、#9音、11音、#11音、13音、b13音再解决到稳定的一级。

乐理是抽象的概念，先通过具体的曲子建立直观感觉，再通过复习乐理理论进行总结和巩固，通过乐理学乐理肯定是低效率的。
 
## 5.新增ii-v：
即是在任何和弦之前，可以任意加上这个和弦的ii-v，或仅ii或v。  
如：原為 C- C- C- C- F，以F為目标和弦，其前改為C-bm7-E7-Am7-D7-Gm7-C7-F

## 6.bii代v：
指两个相距增四度的属七和弦，可以互相替代。  
如：G7与Db有相同的3、7音，因此可以解决到相同主和弦。

属和弦最重要的功能是和声由不和-Xie解决到和-Xie的主和弦。  
如：Dm7-G7-Cmaj7 可替换成 Dm7-Db7-Cmaj7。

[记忆法：简单来说就是251中的2级保持3音位置不变，其他音全部往下退半音，记得要是7和弦哦]

The same melody will have different feelings under different chord arrangements. Using the chords well will make the whole tune very nice. If you don't use them well, it will feel like nursery rhymes. Let's take a look at the various ways of harmony.

## 1. Replacement of chords for mode interchange:
The mode interchange here means that the parallel chords of major and minor are borrowed from each other.
Such as: C major and C minor 7th chord, as long as the replacement chord does not conflict with the melody, it can be replaced.

For example: Fmaj7-Cmaj7-Ebmaj7-G7 (that is, borrow a third chord from a minor key).

## 2. Subordinate seventh chord:
Similar to the concept of adding ii-v, it is to add a dominant chord up to five degrees before the chord, but the new ii-v can be used for any chord, and the subdominant seventh chord refers to the dominant seventh chord of the sequential chord .
For example: A7, b7, C7, D7, E7 are C major chords Dm7, Em7, Fmaj7, G7, Am7 subordinate to seventh chords.
 
## 3. Replace the chord with the same tone:
If there are more than two identical notes between two chords, they can be replaced with each other.

Such as: in C major:
-Cmaj7 of the main chord function has three identical notes with Am7 and Em7, that is, it can be replaced.
-G7, which belongs to the chord function, has the same sound as bm7b5, so it can be replaced.
-Fmaj7 of the subordinate chord function has three identical notes with Dm7, that is, it can be replaced.

(G7 is a sequential chord, F#7 root note is not in the key, that is, it is not considered as an auxiliary seventh chord)
For example: in C minor: Cm7 of the main chord function has three identical notes with Ebmaj7, Abmaj7, and Am7b5, so they can be replaced by each other.

-Fm7 of the subordinate chord function has three identical notes with Dm7b5 and Abmaj7, so they can be replaced with each other.
-G7, which belongs to the chord function, has three common sounds with bDim7, so it can be replaced.

## 4. Add extension sound or change extension sound:
In fact, there is no replacement chord, but the extension tone color is added to the original chord. A good extension or variation extension, as long as it does not conflict with the original melody, is often better than replacing the original chord.

Major chords can add 9th, #11, 13th, or change to a sixth chord. Such as: C is changed to C6.

Minor chords can add 9th, 11th, 13th, or change to minor seventh chord. For example: Cm is changed to Cm(maj7).

The genus seventh chord is the most unstable in harmony. In addition to the extension note, the variation extension note can also be added.

It can add 9 tones, b9 tones, #9 tones, 11 tones, #11 tones, 13 tones, and b13 tones to reach a stable level.

Music theory is an abstract concept. Firstly, the intuitive feeling is established through specific music, and then summarized and consolidated by reviewing the theory of music. The theory of music is definitely inefficient.
 
## 5. Added ii-v:
That is, before any chord, ii-v of this chord can be added arbitrarily, or only ii or v.
For example: originally C- C- C- C- F, with F as the target chord, before it was changed to C-bm7-E7-Am7-D7-Gm7-C7-F

## 6.bii generation v:
Refers to two dominant seventh chords that are separated by four degrees and can be substituted for each other.
For example: G7 and Db have the same 3 and 7 notes, so the same main chord can be resolved.

The most important function of dominant chords is that the harmony is resolved from discord -Xie to the dominant chord of -Xie.
For example: Dm7-G7-Cmaj7 can be replaced with Dm7-Db7-Cmaj7.

[Memory method: Simply put, the 2nd level of 251 keeps the position of the 3rd note, and all other notes go down by a semitone, remember if it is a 7th chord]
