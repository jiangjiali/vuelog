> 斯坦诺维奇提出了人类认知的 “三重心智模型”。

_我们人类是不理性的动物，特别之处在于我们有能力去相信自己大脑构思出来的稀奇古怪的东西。_

——罗伯特 ▪ 富格林《行走于理性的钢丝上》

基思 · 斯坦诺维奇 (KeithE. Stanovich) 是当代著名的心理学家。目前担任加拿大多伦多大学人类发展与应用心理学的国家首席教授。

他的理性时代三部曲：《机器人叛乱》、《超越智商》和《理性与反省心智》作为认知科学和行为经济学的重要著作，照亮了很多人探索智慧的漫漫长路。

在《超越智商：为什么聪明人也会做蠢事》这本著作里，斯坦诺维奇提出了人类认知的 “**三重心智模型”。**

**一、聪明人为什么常常做蠢事？**
------------------

在现实中，我们常常可以看到聪明人做蠢事的案例。例如大学生加入传销组织，女大学生被拐卖，金融学博士的各种投资频频失利，很多企业家、明星迷信风水气功大师等等，令人匪夷所思。

斯坦诺维奇敏锐地注意到这一点，既然 “聪明人” 会干 “蠢事”，那么就意味着认知科学对“聪明” 的界定出了问题。因此，1989 年他参照学习障碍的概念，发明了一个新的词汇——**理性障碍**，**用于描述那类智力测验正常，但思维能力低于人类正常水准的人群。**

“理性障碍” 概念启发了哈佛大学认知科学家帕金斯，1995 年，他注意到**理性障碍**的普遍存在，因此在著作《出类拔萃的 IQ》中引用斯坦诺维奇的 “理性障碍” 来呼唤人们重视反省智力，并发明了一个新词汇——心智程序。

高手过招，互相激发！结果，心智程序概念反过来启发了斯坦诺维奇提出人类心智构架的“双过程理论”，在双系统理论的基础上，斯坦诺维奇提出了**三重心智模型**。**将人类认知能力分成自主心智、算法心智与反省心智三种。其中：**

### **自主心智**

第一、我们通过进化和内隐习得的。例如，我们看到新鲜事物会好奇，看到鳄鱼会本能害怕，属于基因内置程序。是进化让我们习得了对事物本能的喜怒哀乐等情绪化反应。

第二、后天长期训练的技能，已经内隐到自主心智。例如，你非常熟练骑自行车，今天的你骑自行车时做出的动作，几乎是条件反射。还有开车，一旦学会就不会忘记。

### **算法心智**

算法心智就是我们平时口头所说的智力。如果说一个人智力很高，一般上是指这个人的算法心智好。在智力研究领域，目前集大成的是是美国心理学家雷蒙德 · 卡特尔的在 1963 年提出的 CHC 理论。他根据对智力测验结果的分析，将智力分为两类：其一为流体智力，另一个为晶体智力。

**流体智力**：**是指在信息加工和问题解决过程中所表现出来的能力。**

如对关系的认识，类比、演绎推理能力，形成抽象概念的能力等。它较少地依赖于文化和知识的内容，而决定于个人的天赋。流体智力的发展与年龄有密切关系。

一般人在 20 岁以后，流体智力的发展达到顶峰，30 岁以后将随年龄的增长而降低。此外，心理学家们也发现，流体智力属于人类的基本能力，其个别差异受教育文化的影响较少。

**晶体智力**：**是指获得语言，数学等知识的能力，它决定于后天的学习，与社会文化有密切的关系。**

晶体智力在人的一生都有发展，只是到 25 岁以后发展速度日趋平缓。晶体智力受后天的经验影响较大，主要表现为运用已有知识和技能去吸收新知识和解决新问题的能力，这些能力不随年龄的增长而减退，只是某些技能在新的社会条件下变得无用了。

**流体智力指基本心理过程的能力，它随年龄的衰老而减退。**晶体能力在人的一生中一直在发展，它与教育、文化有关，并不因年龄增长而降低，只是到 25 岁以后，发展的速度渐趋平缓。另外，晶体智力是通过掌握社会文化经验而获得的智力。如词汇概念，言语理解，常识等记忆储存信息为能力，一直保持相对稳定。而流体智力呈缓慢下降的趋势。

#### ● **反省心智**

对人类心智过程进行整体监控、帮助执行决策与判断的心智加工过程。是理性思维的表现。就像你身后的一个摄影机，从第三者角度观测你的一举一动。例如元认知、认知偏差等。

斯坦诺维奇的研究结果表明：我们通常所说的智力，也就是算法心智，更多地是做执行，推理，运算的工作，而**反省心智则是理性思维的核心**，它在旁边冷静观察，适时对算法心智进行压制、警告、调整。

心理学家的研究结果是：**理性（反省心智）与智力（算法心智）总体呈现微弱相关**。

![](userdata/images/triple-mental-model.jpg)
三重心智模型

简单来说，聪明人未必理性，聪明和理性不能混为一谈。 聪明和理性是两个独立发展的能力。传统的智商测试，仅仅对算法心智进行了测量，而没有包含任何对于反省心智的测试内容。这样就可以解释为什么聪明人也会做蠢事了。

根据三重心智加工模型，认知科学家还得到一个令人震惊的结论：

**聪明人只有在被告知要怎么做的情况下，才能表现优异。**

如果把人比喻成一辆汽车，智商好比是汽车的行驶速度，而理性则决定了行驶的方向。

所以一个好的领导者不一定很聪明，但一定很理性，就像唐僧时刻坚信自己的目标和方向，时刻反省自己是否偏离方向，一路上遇到多少诱惑都能够从容应对。很多创业者也要经过九九八十一难，是否能够坚守理想和信念，是否每日三省吾身，不为浮华的诱惑所动，才能实现自己的使命和梦想。

在书中，斯坦诺维奇批评了美国社会过度关注智商（IQ），把智力测验当作最重要的评估标准的做法，认为：“相对于智力，理性受到严重的低估”。他呼吁关注个人的理商 RQ（即理性商数），使整个人类社会朝着更理性的方向发展。他通过研究告诉我们：**“理性是可以习得的**！”

**二、那么该如何提升理性能力呢？**
-------------------

斯坦诺维奇将基本思维谬误分为两类：认知吝啬鬼和心智程序问题，并给出了提高理性两大解决方案：

**第一条途径是避免先天的信息加工缺陷（即认知吝啬鬼），**  
**第二条途径是给自己大脑安装好的心智程序，抵制坏的心智程序。**

### **１、认知吝啬鬼**

大脑在使用认知资源是极为吝啬，喜欢走捷径，我们简称为 “**认知吝啬鬼**”，人类在大多是时候都是认知吝啬鬼，这是进化的结果，因为大脑是极为消耗能量的器官，人体存储的能量有限，所以大脑使用遵循 “经济性原则”。

**人类大脑所遵循的准则是：能不用脑，就不要脑，该用脑时也不用脑。**认知吝啬鬼常常致使我们深陷不理性的泥潭，严重阻碍我们实现目标与理想。

#### **认知吝啬鬼的三大特征**

特征一：默认自主心智加工反应，该过程完全没有类型２加工的参与，完全靠直觉反应，是最肤浅的信息加工方式。

特征二、带有焦点偏差的连续性联结认知，过度节约认知资源导致备择世界模型或者完全析取推理过程失败。完全析取推理，是指面临诸多选项做出决策时，或是在推理任务中选出最佳问题解决方案时，对所有可能性及其结果进行分析、采择的思维过程。

特征三、压制失败。类型二加工试图压制并取代自主心智的类型一加工，结果失败。

#### **常见的认知吝啬鬼表现**：

1. 属性替换：简单的代替复杂的。
2. 生动性效应：容易被生动和鲜活证据抓住认知焦点，而忽略统计学证据。
3. 易得式启发式加工：最近最容易提取的内容作为决策的依据。
4. 锚定和调整启发式加工：决策结果被一个相关数值锚定。
5. 默认启发式加工：能不改变，就不改变。
6. 框架效应：对本质相同但是表面不相同的问题给出不同的答案。
7. 过度自信：人容易高估自己的能力。
8. 我方立场加工：正反都是我对。

### **２、心智程序问题**

**心智程序是指个体可以从记忆中提取得规则、知识、程序和策略，以辅助决策判断和问题解决过程。**

大卫帕金斯认为导致不良决策的两大重要原因：

1. 心智程序缺陷  
2. 污化的心智程序

#### **第一大原因：心智程序缺陷**

心智程序缺陷指的是个体心智程序未获得足以支持理性思维的规则、策略和知识，心智程序缺陷通常是由于缺乏教育或经验产生的，但也有一些高智商的个体缺乏一些重要的关键的心智程序，而很多低智商的个体也会使用心智程序做出理性的反应。

例如：低智商的骗子一样可以骗的了高智商的博士。因为拥有晶体知识并不代表拥有晶体理性，斯坦诺维奇认为要提高理性，要给大脑安装好的心智程序，可以学习以下五类知识才能弥补自己心智程序缺陷。

1、概率推理知识  
2、决策科学知识  
3、科学推理知识  
4、逻辑推理知识  
5、经济学思维

#### **第二大原因：污化的心智程序**

污化心智程序：心智程序的某些知识本身就是导致非理性行为和思维的罪魁祸首。

例如：庞氏骗局和金字塔传销骗局以及邪教组织都是把污化的心智程序植入到个体中，心智程序受到污染的人开始认为他们每天都在身边见到的，他们一辈子都在经历的经济规律可以违背，他们开始相信一夜暴富，开始怀疑自己的勤劳致富，他们开始相信躺着就可以赚钱，他们梦想着自己建一个管道就能让自己一劳永逸，他们相信这种新型的投资方式的回报率远远高于传统的金融工具，并且毫无风险。

骗局的策划人通常会运用生动效应、框架效应、锚定效应、启发式加工等各种认知偏差去说服别人，他们绞尽脑汁设计各种套路，让普通人看来合情合理，想法设法让普通人做出非理性的决策。

但是无论这些骗子说的多么精妙绝伦，也无法掩饰他们的污化心智程序，稍微懂点科学知识、决策知识和概率知识的人，稍微具备一点批判性思维、证伪知识、心理学知识的人都可以很快识别骗局。

所以学习很重要，学习可以让我们去伪存真，发现事物的本质。同时学习就要学习好的科学知识，不能学习污化的心智程序知识，下面是斯坦诺维奇总结的８类污化的心智程序，如果你安装在自己的头脑里，你的大脑就中毒了，他会成为你的晶体理性抑制剂，带领你走入泥潭，陷入深渊。

以上只是８种常见的污化心智程序，但并不代表全部。污化的心智程序都很会伪装，如何识别污化的心智程序呢？**只有把握原则，才能精准识别，让病毒无处可逃。**

**斯坦诺维奇认为避免安装坏的心智程序的四大规则**

１、避免安装可能对你产生生理伤害的心智程序，比如自残。  
２、关注影响你目标的心智程序，确保它不妨碍目标选择的多样性，比如让你只相信它的思想。  
３、关注同认识世界相关的信念和模型，努力只安装正确的心智程序，也就是真实反映世界的心智程序，不选择过激的价值观。  
４、避免拒绝对自身进行评估的心智程序，比如神秘主义色彩思想。

### 最后**总结**

在一会议上，有一位女士非要查理．芒格用一个词语说出他的成功之道，芒格回答：理性！芒格曾经说过：“如果你想成为一个理性的思想者，必须培养出跨越常规学科疆域的头脑，必须跨学科学习，学习重要学科的重要思维模型”。

因为这是一个复杂的世界，这是一个危险的世界，这是一个野兽乐园，这是一个战场，生物进化的第一任务是生存，资源是有限的，为了获得生存资源我们可以做出一切，这是大自然残酷法则。

为了生存我们进化出了文明、道德和理性，不管你多么聪明，也会犯非理性的错误，正如斯坦诺维奇所说 “聪明的人只有在被告知要如何做的情况下，才会表现优异”。告知你如何做的，不是别人，而是你自己。在这个极端复杂和危险的世界里，到处充满了黑暗，而理性就是带领我们走在黑暗森林的灯塔。

> Stanovich proposed the "triple mental model" of human cognition.

_We humans are irrational animals. The special thing is that we have the ability to believe in the weird things that our brains have conceived._

——Robert Fuggin "Walking on the Wire of Reason"

KeithE. Stanovich is a famous contemporary psychologist. Currently serving as the National Chief Professor of Human Development and Applied Psychology at the University of Toronto, Canada.

His trilogy of the Age of Reason: "Robot Rebellion", "Beyond IQ" and "Reason and Reflective Mind", as important works of cognitive science and behavioral economics, have illuminated the long way for many people to explore wisdom.

In the book "Beyond IQ: Why Smart People Do Stupid Things", Stanovich proposed the "** Triple Mental Model" of human cognition. **

**1. Why do smart people often do stupid things?**
------------------

In reality, we can often see cases of smart people doing stupid things. For example, college students join MLM organizations, female college students are abducted, and various investments of PhDs in finance have frequently failed. Many entrepreneurs and celebrities believe in Feng Shui Qigong masters, etc., which is incredible.

Stanovich is keenly aware of this. Since "smart people" can do "stupid things", it means that cognitive science has a problem with the definition of "smart". Therefore, in 1989, referring to the concept of learning disabilities, he invented a new vocabulary—**rational disorder**, which is used to describe people who have normal intelligence tests but whose thinking ability is below the normal level of humans. **

The concept of "rational barriers" inspired Perkins, a cognitive scientist at Harvard University. In 1995, he noticed the widespread existence of **rational barriers**, so he cited Stanovich's "rational barriers" in his book "IQ of Excellence". "To call people to attach importance to introspection of intelligence, and invented a new vocabulary-mental program.

Master tricks, inspire each other! As a result, the concept of mental program in turn inspired Stanovich to put forward the "dual process theory" of the human mental framework. On the basis of the double system theory, Stanovich proposed the **triple mental model**. **The human cognitive ability is divided into three types: autonomous mind, algorithmic mind and reflective mind. among them:**

### **Autonomous Mind**

First, we learned through evolution and implicitly. For example, we are curious when we see new things, and we are instinctively afraid when we see crocodiles, which are genetic programs. It is evolution that allows us to learn emotional reactions such as instinctive emotions such as happiness, anger, sorrow, and joy.

Second, the skills acquired for a long time have already been implicit in the autonomous mind. For example, you are very proficient in riding a bicycle, and the actions you make when riding a bicycle today are almost conditioned. There is also driving, once you learn, you will not forget it.

### **Algorithmic Mind**

Algorithmic mind is what we usually call intelligence. If a person has high intelligence, it generally means that the person's algorithmic mind is good. In the field of intelligence research, the current masterpiece is the CHC theory proposed by American psychologist Raymond Cartel in 1963. Based on the analysis of the intelligence test results, he divided intelligence into two categories: one is fluid intelligence, and the other is crystal intelligence.

**Fluid Intelligence**: ** refers to the ability shown in the process of information processing and problem solving. **

Such as the understanding of relationships, analogy, deductive reasoning ability, and the ability to form abstract concepts. It is less dependent on the content of culture and knowledge, but determined by personal talent. The development of fluid intelligence is closely related to age.

After the average person is 20 years old, the development of fluid intelligence reaches its peak, and after 30 years old, it will decrease with age. In addition, psychologists have also found that fluid intelligence is a basic human ability, and its individual differences are less affected by education and culture.

**Crystal Intelligence**: ** refers to the ability to acquire knowledge of language, mathematics, etc. It is determined by acquired learning and has a close relationship with social culture. **

Crystal intelligence develops throughout a person's life, but the speed of development gradually slows down after the age of 25. Crystal intelligence is greatly affected by acquired experience. It is mainly manifested in the ability to use existing knowledge and skills to absorb new knowledge and solve new problems. These abilities do not decrease with age, but certain skills change under new social conditions. It's useless.

**Fluid intelligence refers to the ability of basic mental processes, which decreases with age.**Crystal abilities have been developing throughout a person's life. It is related to education and culture. It does not decrease due to age. It is just that after the age of 25, the speed of development gradually slows down. In addition, crystal intelligence is the intelligence acquired by mastering social and cultural experience. Such as vocabulary concepts, speech comprehension, common sense, etc., the ability to store information as memory has remained relatively stable. The fluid intelligence is slowly decreasing.

#### ● **Reflection on the mind**

The mental processing process that monitors the human mental process as a whole and helps implement decision-making and judgment. It is a manifestation of rational thinking. It's like a camera behind you, observing your every move from the perspective of a third party. Such as metacognition, cognitive bias, etc.

The results of Stanovich’s research show that what we usually call intelligence, that is, algorithmic mind, is more about execution, reasoning, and calculation, while **retrospective mind is the core of rational thinking**. Observe calmly from the side, suppress, warn, and adjust the algorithm mind in a timely manner.

Psychologists’ research results are: **Rationality (retrospective mind) and intelligence (algorithmic mind) are generally weakly correlated**.

![](userdata/images/triple-mental-model.jpg)
Triple mental model

To put it simply, smart people are not necessarily rational, and smart and rational cannot be confused. Smart and rational are two independently developed abilities. The traditional IQ test only measures the algorithmic mind, and does not contain any test content for the reflective mind. This can explain why smart people do stupid things.

According to the triple mental processing model, cognitive scientists also came to a shocking conclusion:

**Smart people can only perform well when they are told what to do.**

If you compare a person to a car, IQ is like the speed of a car, and rationality determines the direction of travel.

Therefore, a good leader is not necessarily very smart, but must be very rational, just like Tang Seng always firmly believes in his goals and direction, always reflects on whether he has deviated from the direction, and can calmly deal with all the temptations he encounters along the way. Many entrepreneurs have to go through the nine-nine-nine-eighty-one difficulties, whether they can stick to their ideals and beliefs, whether they think about themselves every day, and are not moved by the temptation of vanity in order to realize their missions and dreams.

In the book, Stanovich criticized the American society's excessive attention to intelligence quotient (IQ) and the practice of using intelligence tests as the most important evaluation criterion, saying: "Rationality is seriously underestimated relative to intelligence." He called for attention to individual rational quotient RQ (that is, rational quotient) to make the entire human society develop in a more rational direction. He told us through research: **"Rationality can be learned**!"

**Second, how to improve rational ability?**
-------------------

Stanovich divides the basic thinking fallacies into two categories: cognitive miser and mental process problems, and gives two solutions to improve rationality:

**The first way is to avoid innate information processing defects (ie cognitive miser),**
**The second way is to install good mental programs for one's brain and resist bad mental programs.**

### **1, cognitive miser**

The brain is extremely stingy in using cognitive resources and likes to take shortcuts. We call it "**cognitive miser**" for short. Human beings are cognitive miser most of the time. This is the result of evolution, because the brain is extremely Energy-consuming organs, the human body has limited energy storage, so the use of the brain follows the "economic principle".

**The principle that the human brain follows is: if you can use the brain, don't use the brain, and don't use the brain when you should.**The cognitive miser often causes us to fall into the quagmire of irrationality, which seriously hinders us from achieving our goals and ideals.

#### **Three characteristics of cognitive miser**

Feature 1: Default autonomous mental processing response, this process is completely without the participation of Type 2 processing, and relies entirely on intuitive response, which is the most superficial information processing method.

Feature 2: Continuously connected cognition with focus deviation, excessive saving of cognitive resources leads to failure of alternative world models or complete disjunctive reasoning process. Completely disjunctive reasoning refers to the thinking process of analyzing and selecting all possibilities and their results when a decision is made when faced with many options, or when the best solution to a problem is selected in a reasoning task.

Feature three, suppression failed. Type 2 processing tried to suppress and replace the type 1 processing of the autonomous mind, but failed.

#### **Common performance of cognitive miser**:

1. Attribute substitution: simple instead of complex.
2. Vivid effect: It is easy to be caught the cognitive focus by vivid and fresh evidence, while ignoring statistical evidence.
3. Easy-to-get heuristic processing: The most easily extracted content recently serves as the basis for decision-making.
4. Anchor and adjust heuristic processing: The decision result is anchored by a relevant value.
5. Default heuristic processing: if it can be changed, it will not change.
6. Frame effect: Give different answers to questions that are the same in nature but different on the surface.
7. Overconfidence: People tend to overestimate their abilities.
8. Processing of our position: I am right on both sides.

### **2. Mental process issues**

**Mental procedures refer to the rules, knowledge, procedures and strategies that individuals can extract from memory to assist in decision-making and problem-solving processes.**

David Perkins believes that there are two important reasons for bad decisions:

1. Defects of mental process
2. The mental process of pollution

#### **The first reason: mental programming flaws**

Mental program defects refer to the fact that the individual's mental programs have not obtained sufficient rules, strategies and knowledge to support rational thinking. Mental program defects are usually caused by lack of education or experience, but there are also high IQ individuals who lack some important key mental programs. , And many individuals with low IQ will use mental processes to react rationally.

For example, a liar with a low IQ can deceive a doctor with a high IQ. Because possessing crystal knowledge does not mean possessing crystal rationality, Stanovich believes that to improve rationality, it is necessary to install a good mental program for the brain. You can learn the following five types of knowledge to make up for your mental program defects.

1. Probabilistic reasoning knowledge
2. Decision science knowledge
3. Scientific reasoning knowledge
4. Knowledge of logical reasoning
5. Economic thinking

#### **Second reason: the mental process of pollution**

Defilement of the mental process: certain knowledge of the mental process itself is the chief culprit leading to irrational behavior and thinking.

For example: Ponzi schemes, pyramid schemes, and cult organizations all implant polluted mental programs into individuals. People whose mental programs are contaminated begin to think that they see it by their side every day, and the economy they have experienced throughout their lives. Laws can be violated. They began to believe in getting rich overnight, they began to doubt their hard work to get rich, they began to believe that they could make money lying down, they dreamed that they could build a pipeline to make themselves permanent and they believed in the return of this new investment method The rate is much higher than that of traditional financial instruments, and there is no risk.

The planners of scams usually use various cognitive biases such as vivid effect, framing effect, anchoring effect, heuristic processing, etc. to convince others. They rack their brains to design various routines to make ordinary people seem reasonable and reasonable, and try to make ordinary people think People make irrational decisions.

But no matter how exquisite these scammers are, they cannot conceal their defilement of mental procedures. People who have a little bit of scientific knowledge, decision-making knowledge, and knowledge of probability, and those who have a little bit of critical thinking, falsification knowledge, and psychological knowledge. Both can quickly identify scams.

Therefore, learning is very important. Learning allows us to discover the essence of things. At the same time, you must learn good scientific knowledge. You cannot learn the knowledge of polluted mental programs. The following are the eight types of polluted mental programs summarized by Stanovich. If you install it in your own mind, your brain will be poisoned. , He will become your crystal rational inhibitor, leading you into the quagmire and into the abyss.

The above are just eight common mental decontamination procedures, but they do not represent all of them. Polluted mental programs are very disguised. How to identify polluted mental programs? **Only by grasping the principles, can we accurately identify and let the virus have nowhere to escape.**

**Stanovic believes four rules to avoid installing bad mental programs**

1. Avoid installing mental programs that may cause physical harm to you, such as self-harm.
2. Pay attention to the mental process that affects your goals, and make sure that it does not hinder the diversity of goal choices, such as making you believe only in its thoughts.
3. Pay attention to beliefs and models related to understanding the world, and strive to install only correct mental programs, that is, mental programs that truly reflect the world, and do not choose excessive values.
4. Avoid mental procedures that refuse to evaluate yourself, such as mysticism.

### Finally **Summary**

At a meeting, a lady insisted on Charlie. Munger used one word to say his way to success, and Munger replied: Reason! Munger once said: "If you want to be a rational thinker, you must cultivate a mind that transcends the boundaries of conventional disciplines, you must study across disciplines, and learn important thinking models of important disciplines."

Because this is a complex world, this is a dangerous world, this is a beast paradise, this is a battlefield, the first task of biological evolution is survival, resources are limited, in order to obtain survival resources we can do everything, This is the cruel law of nature.

In order to survive, we have evolved civilization, morality, and rationality. No matter how smart you are, you will also make irrational mistakes. As Stanovich said, “Smart people will only behave when they are told how to do it. Excellent". Tell you how to do it, not others, but yourself. In this extremely complex and dangerous world, darkness is everywhere, and reason is the beacon that leads us in the dark forest.
