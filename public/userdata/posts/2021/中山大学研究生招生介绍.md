## 初试考试
### 1、考试科目
* 科目一：101 思想政治理论(100分)
* 科目二：204 英语二（100分）
* 科目三：03 数学三（150分）
* 科目四：431 金融学综合（150分）

基础阶段的复习，主要是熟悉基本概念，基本理论，记住公式，做题也主要以基础题为主。强化阶段就要专攻难点，把基础阶段不太理解的知识点拿下，计算题也要开始做比较综合，比较有难度的题目；搞定计算题后，就要按专题去总结论述题。冲刺阶段就是做真题，反复巩固重点、考点。

中山大学的这三个院系都招收金融专硕，初试考试科目是完全一样的，只在复试的时候有区别，所以同学们在备考初期可以不用考虑过多。

### 2、参考书
考试内容包括货币金融学（货币银行学和国际金融）、投资学、公司财务的基本知识和核心内容。主要考查考生对现代金融理论基础知识的掌握程度，对金融市场的结构和功能了解的程度，掌握金融工具的特征、定价及运用的熟练程度，以及将金融理论和金融工具应用于公司财务决策及解决现实金融问题的能力和技巧。

中山大学并未给出参考书目，只给出了上方的考试内容，推荐如下参考书，供同学们参考：

**胡庆康《现代货币银行学教程》，第五版，复旦大学出版社**  
本书写得很不错，特别详尽。不过，任何事情有好也有坏，太详尽就意味着看书太累。事实上，从应付考研看，千万不要纠结于本书一些细节内容，一定要学会抓重点。

**米什金《货币金融学》，第十一版，中国人民大学出版社**  
金融是一个外来品，我们一定要了解国外成熟经济体金融市场(体系)运行情况，所以除了看国内老师的教材，还需要看国外教材，而米什金老师的这本书无疑是一本非常经典的书，可以供后期看(先看国内老师编写的书，后看这本书)。

**姜波克《国际金融新编》，第五版，复旦大学出版社**  
中山大学历年考题涉及国际金融的内容不少，考生可以参照姜波克的《国际金融新编》复习，不过不需要把姜波克《国际金融新编》这本书从头看到尾，只需要看教材：第二章“国际收支和国际收支平衡表”、第三章“汇率基础理论”、第四章“内部均衡和外部平衡的短期调节”、第六章“外汇管理及其效率分析”、第七章“金融全球化对内外均衡的冲击”和第八章“金融全球化下的国际协调与合作”。

**罗斯《公司理财》，第十一版，机械工业出版社**  
罗斯《公司理财》一共31章，重点考前面19章!虽然后面章节也可能会考，不过鉴于考中山大学的考生还会看博迪《投资学》，所以重点看教材前面19章。

**博迪《投资学》，第十版，机械工业出版社**  
记住，先看罗斯《公司理财》，再看博迪《投资学》，因为投资学是深化公司理财一些模型等。博迪《投资学》课后习题非常经典，一定要好好做哦。

**张亦春《金融市场学》，第五版，高等教育出版社**  
如果考名校(自然报考中山大学)，一定要看张亦春老师的《金融市场学》，这本书非常经典。这本书是一本工具书，包括金融、国际金融、公司理财和投资学，所以适合后期看。看完这本书，一定会对之前学过的知识点有更深理解。

### 2. School of management
Founded in 1985, the school of management is the earliest institution specialized in business administration education and research in China. Since its establishment, relying on the profound cultural tradition and academic heritage of Sun Yat sen University, and with the strong support of Ho's education foundation, Fok Ying Tung foundation, Peihua Education Foundation and other funds at home and abroad, it has become a top domestic and internationally renowned business school.

## Preliminary examination
### 1. Examination subjects
* Subject 1: 101 ideological and Political Theory (100 points) 
* Subject 2: 204 English 2 (100 points) 
* Subject 3: 03 Mathematics 3 (150 points) 
* Subject 4: 431 comprehensive finance (150 points)

The review of the basic stage is mainly to be familiar with the basic concepts, basic theories, remember the formula, and do the basic questions. In the strengthening stage, we should focus on the difficult points, take down the knowledge points that we don't understand in the basic stage, and start to do more comprehensive and difficult calculation problems; after solving the calculation problems, we should summarize and discuss the problems according to the special topic. Sprint stage is to do the real problem, repeatedly consolidate the key points, test points.

These three departments of Sun Yat sen University all recruit master degree candidates in finance. The subjects of the first examination are exactly the same, and there are differences only in the second examination. Therefore, students need not think too much in the initial stage of preparing for the examination.

### 2. Reference books
The examination content includes the basic knowledge and core content of monetary finance (monetary banking and international finance), investment, and corporate finance. It mainly tests the candidates' mastery of the basic knowledge of modern financial theory, their understanding of the structure and function of financial market, their proficiency in the characteristics, pricing and application of financial instruments, and their ability and skills in applying financial theory and financial instruments to the company's financial decision-making and solving real financial problems.

Sun Yat sen University does not give a bibliography, but only gives the examination content above. The following reference books are recommended for students' reference:

**Hu Qingkang, a course of modern money and banking, 5th Edition, Fudan University Press**  
This book is very well written, especially detailed. However, everything has good and bad, too detailed means reading too tired. In fact, from the perspective of coping with the postgraduate entrance examination, we must not entangle in some details of this book, we must learn to grasp the key points.

**Mishkin, monetary finance, 11th Edition, China Renmin University Press**  
Finance is a foreign product. We must understand the operation of the financial market (system) of foreign mature economies. Therefore, in addition to reading the textbooks of domestic teachers, we also need to read the foreign textbooks. This book of Mr. Mishkin is undoubtedly a very classic book, which can be read later (read the book written by domestic teachers first, and then read this book).

**Jiang Boke, new edition of international finance, Fifth Edition, Fudan University Press**  
There are many questions about international finance in Sun Yat sen University over the years. Candidates can refer to Jiang Boke's new edition of international finance for review. However, there is no need to read Jiang Boke's new edition of international finance from the beginning to the end. They only need to read the textbook: Chapter II "balance of payments and balance of payments", Chapter III "basic theory of exchange rate", Chapter IV "internal balance and external balance" Chapter 6 "foreign exchange management and its efficiency analysis", Chapter 7 "the impact of financial globalization on internal and external equilibrium" and Chapter 8 "international coordination and cooperation under financial globalization".

**Rose, corporate finance, 11th Edition, China Machine Press**  
Rose's "corporate finance" has 31 chapters in total, with the focus on the first 19 chapters! Although the latter chapters may also be tested, the candidates of Sun Yat sen University will also see Bodhi's "investment", so they will focus on the first 19 chapters of the textbook.

**Brody, investment, 10th edition, China Machine Press**  
Remember, first look at Rose's corporate finance, and then look at Bodie's investment, because investment is to deepen some models of corporate finance. Bodhi's "investment" after class exercises are very classic, we must do it well.

**Zhang Yichun, financial market, 5th Edition, higher education press**  
If you want to apply to a famous University (Sun Yat sen University), you must read Mr. Zhang Yichun's "financial market", which is a classic book. This book is a reference book, including finance, international finance, corporate finance and investment, so it is suitable for later reading. After reading this book, I will have a deeper understanding of what I have learned before.
