## FrequencyResponse 频率响应
音响系统的频率特性常用分贝刻度的纵坐标表示功率和用对数刻度的横坐标表示频率的频率响应曲线来描述。

频率响应是对MP3播放器的数模/模数转换器频率响应能力的一个评价标准。好的频率响应，是在每一个频率点都能输出稳定足够的信号，不同频率点彼此之间的信号大小均一样。然而在低频与高频部分，信号的重建比较困难，所以在这两个频段通常都会有衰减的现象。输出品质越好的装置，频率响应曲线就越平直，反之不但在 高低频处衰减得很快，在一般频段，也可能呈现抖动的现象。

频率响应是指将一个以恒电压输出的 音频 信号与系统相连接时，音箱产生的声压随频率的变化而发生增大或衰减、相位随频率而发生变化的现象，这种声压和相位与频率的相关联的变化关系（变化量）称为频率响应，频率响应范围是最低有效声音频率到最高有效声音频率之间的范围，单位为赫兹（Hz）。

## THD+N 总谐波失真+噪声
THD+N是英文Total Hormonic Distortion + Noise的缩写译成中文是“总谐波失真加噪声”。它是音频功率放大器的一个主要性能指标，也是音频功率放大器的额定输出功率的一个条件。

实际的音频功率放大器有各种谐波造成的失真及由器件内或外部造成的噪声，它有一定的THD+N的值。这个值一般在0.00n%-10%之间(n=1～9) 。

THD+N表示失真+噪声，因此THD+N自然越小越好。但这个指标是在一定条件下测试的。同一个音频功率放大器，若改变其条件，其THD+N的值会有很大的变动。

一般说，输出功率小（如几十mW）的高质量音频功率放大器（如用于MP3播放机），它的THD+N指标可达10-5，具有较高的保真度。输出几百mW的音频功率放大器，要用扬声器放音，其THD+N一般为10-4；输出功率在1～2W ，其THD+N更大些，一般为0.1～0.5%。

THD+N这一指标大小与音频功率放大器的结构类别有关（如A类功放、D类功放），例如D类功放的噪声较大，则THD+N的值也较A类大。

这里特别要指出的是资料中给出的THD+N这个指标是在FIN=1kHz下给出的，在实际上音频范围是20Hz～20kHz，则在20Hz～20kHz范围测试时，其THD+N要大得多。例如，某音频功率放大器在1kHz时测试，其TDH+N=0.08%。若FIN改成20Hz-20kHz，其他条件不变，其THD+N变为小于0.5%。

输出功率在100mW左右的音频功率放大器常用THD+N=0.1%作为额定输出功率的条件。例如，某立体声耳机的音频功率放大器，在THD+N=0.1%，输出功率为80mW。这80mW可看作该音频功放的额定输出功率。

输出功率达几百毫瓦的常用THD+N=1%为条件。

如某音频功率放大器在Vcc=5V、THD+N=1%时可输出330mW。这330mW也可看作是在Vcc=5V时的额定输出功率。

从上面可以看出；这里的THD+N=0.1%、1%的值仅仅作为输出额定功率的一个条件。实际应用时比额定输出功率要小，其THD+N的值也要小得多。例如，Vcc=5V，额定输出功率为330mW时，其条件是THD+N=1%。若同样在Vcc=5V，输出功率降为120mW时，其THD+N的典型值仅为0.02%。失真是指音响系统对音源信号进行重放后，使原音源信号的某些部分（波形、频率等等）发生了变化。音响系统的失真主要有以下几种：

* 谐波失真  
所谓谐波失真是指音响系统重放后的声音比原有信号源多出许多额外的谐波成分。此额外的谐波成分信号是信号源频率的倍频或分频，它是由负反馈网络或放大器的非线性特性引起的。高保真音响系统的谐波 失真应小于1%。

* 互调失真  
互调失真也是一种非线性失真，它是两个以上的频率分量按一定比例混合，各个频率信号之间互相调制，通过放音设备后产生新 增加的非线性信号，该信号包括各个信号之间的和及差的信号。

* 瞬态失真  
瞬态失真又称瞬态响应，它的产生主要是当较大的瞬态信号突然加到放大器时由于放大器的反映较慢，从而使信号产生失真。

一般以输入方波信号通过放音设备后，观察放大器输出信号的包络波形是否输入的方波波形相似来表达放大器对瞬态信号的跟随能力。

## Channel Separation 通道分离度
通道分离度是指各声道间互相干扰的隔离能力，也不必多言，当然越高越好了。随着数字音响系统取代普通磁带录放机，数字环绕声代替模拟系统，获得高的通道分离度已困难不大，关键在于A-D/D-A和模拟电路的性能。

声道分离度，是指不同声道间立体声的隔离程度，用一个声道的信号电平与串入另一声道的信号电平差来表示。这个差值越大越好。一般要求Hi-Fi音响分离度>50dB。声道平衡度，是指两个声道的增益、频响等特性的一致性。否则，将造成声道声象的偏移。

立体声分离度表示立体声音响系统中左、右两个声道之间的隔离度，它实际上反映了左、右两个声道相互串扰的程度。如果两个声道之间串扰较大，那么重放声音的立体感将减弱。

左、右信号分离度：左右信号间的相互泄漏量叫做左右信号的分离度。  
用数字式表示如下：

**Se=20lg x [El(或Er)/Er(或El)]**

Se分离度，用dB表示；  
El(或Er)发射机仅有L(或R)通道输入音频电压调制时，解调器的左(或右)路输出，单位为V；  
Er(或El)发射机仅有R(或L)通道输入音频电压调制时，解调器的右(或左)路输出，单位为V。

## Dynamic Range 动态范围
动态范围是指音响系统重放时最大不失真输出功率与静态时系统噪声输出功率之比的对数值，又指一个多媒体硬盘播放器输出图像的最亮和最暗部分之间的相对比值。单位为分贝(dB)。一般性能较好的音响系统的动态范围在100(dB)以上。

动态范围是指设备能够处理的最大信号与最小信号的比值。这个概念容易与“信噪比”的概念混淆，那么二者有什么区别呢?可以理解，小于噪声幅度的信号是无法正确还原的，但是有的设备能够在无信号或信号特别低时从某些环节将噪声连同小信号切除，从而得出更好的信 噪比指标(这就是“动态降噪”的基本原理)。这时实质上还是无法正确处理小信号的，而动态范围的测量就可以避免这样的人为优化。动态范围的测量是用一个小信号(一般用-60dB/1000Hz的正弦波)输给设备，然后滤除信号，测量其余频率的噪声和谐波水平，再用最大信号与之相比，结果就是动态范围。

可以预见动态范围一般要低于信噪比，但在没有特殊电路或软件处理噪声的情况下，一般二者差距不大，可以互相参考。图中给出了动态范围测试的结果。这里基本没有产生大于噪声的谐波，因此动态范围和信噪比是基本一样的。

需要指出，测量出的动态范围与“理论上”的动态范围是不同的。例如现在的数字音源，大多用数字信号能够还原的理论值来标注，例如CD的动态范围96dB，DVD采用24bit记录能达到144dB!实际上由于模拟器件的限制，那样的指标是根本不可能实现的，你只需测试一下其噪声水平就知道了。只不过目前音像节目后期制作大部分都是用计算机数字处理的，在许多环节的处理过程中用高比特可以尽量避免信号劣化。(实际上甚至可能用48bit量化来处理!)

## Channel Unbalance 平衡度
立体声平衡度表示立体放音系统中左、右声道增益的差别，如果不平衡度过大，重放的立体声的声像定位将产生偏移。一般高品质音响系统的立体声平衡度应小于1dB。

## S/N信噪比
信噪比，表示信号与噪声电平的分贝差，用S/N或SNR(dB)表示。噪声频率的高低，信号的强弱对人耳的影响不一样。通常，人耳对4~8kHz的噪声最灵敏，弱信号比强信号受噪声影响较突出。而音响设备不同，信噪比要求也不一样，如Hi-Fi音响要求SNR>70dB，CD机要求SNR>90dB。

信噪比又称为讯噪比，英文全称是(The Signal To Noise Ratio)，通常以S/N表示。无论对于任何音频产品，信噪比都是一个比较重要的参数。信噪比是指音响系统对音源的重放声与整个系统产生的新的噪声的比值，其噪声主要有热噪声、交流噪声、机械噪声等等。一般检测此项指标以重放信号的额定输出功率与无信号输入时系统噪声输出功率的对数比值分贝(dB)来表示。信噪比越高表示音频产品越好，设备的信噪比越高表明它产生的杂音越少。例如CD机的信噪比可达90dB以上，高档的更可达110dB以上。

音频信噪比是指音响设备播放时，正常声音信号强度与噪声信号强度的比值。当信噪比低，小信号输入时噪音严重，在整个音域的声音明显变得浑浊不清，不知发的是什么音，严重影响音质。信噪比的大小是用有用信号功率(或电压)和噪声功率(或电压)比值的对数来表示的。这样计算出来的单位称为“贝尔”。实用中因为贝尔这个单位太大，所以用它的十分之一做计算单位，称为“分贝”。对于便携式DVD来说，信噪比至少应该在70dB以上，才可以考虑。

## Frequency response
The frequency characteristic of sound system is usually described by the frequency response curve with the ordinate of decibel scale representing power and the abscissa of logarithmic scale representing frequency.

Frequency response is an evaluation standard of the frequency response ability of the digital to analog / digital converter of MP3 player. Good frequency response means that stable and sufficient signals can be output at each frequency point, and the signal size between different frequency points is the same. However, in the low-frequency and high-frequency parts, signal reconstruction is more difficult, so there is usually attenuation in these two bands. The better the output quality of the device, the straighter the frequency response curve. On the contrary, it not only decays very fast at high and low frequency, but also appears jitter in general frequency band.

![](userdata/images/FrequencyResponse.jpg)

Frequency response refers to a constant voltage output of audio When the signal is connected with the system, the sound pressure produced by the speaker will increase or decrease with the change of frequency, and the phase will change with the change of frequency. The change relationship between the sound pressure, phase and frequency is called frequency response. The frequency response range is the range from the lowest effective sound frequency to the highest effective sound frequency, and the unit is Hertz (Hz).

## THD + N total harmonic distortion + noise
Thd + n is the abbreviation of total harmonic distortion + noise in English, which translates into "Total Harmonic Distortion plus noise" in Chinese. It is not only a main performance index of audio power amplifier, but also a condition of rated output power of audio power amplifier.

The actual audio power amplifier has distortion caused by various harmonics and noise caused by internal or external components. It has a certain thd + n value. This value is generally between 0.00n% - 10% (n = 1-9).

THD + N means distortion + noise, so the smaller the thd + N, the better. But this index is tested under certain conditions. The thd + n value of the same audio power amplifier will change greatly if its condition is changed.

Generally speaking, the thd + n index of high-quality audio power amplifier with small output power (such as tens of MW) can reach 10-5, and it has high fidelity. When the output power of an audio power amplifier is several hundred MW, the thd + n is usually 10-4; when the output power is 1-2W, the thd + n is larger, generally 0.1-0.5%.

The index of thd + n is related to the structure category of audio power amplifier (such as class a power amplifier and class D power amplifier). For example, if the noise of class D power amplifier is larger, the value of thd + n is also larger than that of class a power amplifier.

In particular, it should be pointed out that the thd + n index given in the data is given under fin = 1kHz. In fact, if the audio frequency range is 20Hz ~ 20kHz, the thd + n is much larger when testing in the 20Hz ~ 20kHz range. For example, when an audio power amplifier is tested at 1kHz, its TDH + n = 0.08%. If fin is changed to 20Hz-20KHz and other conditions remain unchanged, thd + n becomes less than 0.5%.

Thd + n = 0.1% is commonly used as the condition of rated output power for audio power amplifier with output power of about 100MW. For example, the audio power amplifier of a stereo headset has an output power of 80mW at thd + n = 0.1%. This 80 MW can be regarded as the rated output power of the audio power amplifier.

When the output power reaches several hundred milliwatts, thd + n = 1% is commonly used.

For example, an audio power amplifier can output 330MW when VCC = 5V and thd + n = 1%. This 330MW can also be regarded as the rated output power at VCC = 5V.

It can be seen from the above that thd + n = 0.1% and 1% are only used as a condition for the output rated power. In practical application, the thd + n value is much smaller than the rated output power. For example, when VCC = 5V and rated output power is 330MW, the condition is thd + n = 1%. If VCC = 5V and the output power drops to 120mW, the typical value of thd + n is only 0.02%. Distortion means that some parts of the original sound source signal (waveform, frequency, etc.) have changed after the sound system replays the sound source signal. The distortion of sound system is mainly as follows:

* Harmonic distortion  
The so-called harmonic distortion refers to the sound system after playback than the original signal source many additional harmonic components. The extra harmonic component signal is the frequency multiplication or frequency division of the signal source frequency, which is caused by the nonlinear characteristics of the negative feedback network or amplifier. The harmonic distortion of high fidelity audio system should be less than 1%.

* Intermodulation distortion  
Intermodulation distortion is also a kind of nonlinear distortion. It is the mixture of more than two frequency components according to a certain proportion. Each frequency signal modulates with each other and generates a new nonlinear signal through the playback equipment. The signal includes the sum and difference of each signal.

* Transient distortion  
Transient distortion, also known as transient response, is mainly caused by the slow response of the amplifier when a large transient signal is suddenly added to the amplifier.

Generally, the ability of the amplifier to follow the transient signal is expressed by observing whether the envelope waveform of the output signal of the amplifier is similar to the input square wave waveform after the input square wave signal passes through the playback device.

## Channel separation
Channel separation refers to the ability to isolate interference between channels. Needless to say, the higher the better. With the replacement of ordinary tape recorder and player by digital audio system and the replacement of analog system by digital surround sound system, it is not difficult to obtain high channel separation. The key lies in the performance of A-D / D-A and analog circuit.

Channel separation refers to the degree of stereo isolation between different channels. It is expressed by the difference between the signal level of one channel and that of another channel. The bigger the difference, the better. It is generally required that the hi fi sound separation is more than 50dB. Channel balance refers to the consistency of the gain, frequency response and other characteristics of two channels. Otherwise, it will cause the deviation of sound image.

Stereo separation is the degree of isolation between the left and right channels in a stereo system. It actually reflects the degree of crosstalk between the left and right channels. If the crosstalk between the two channels is large, the stereo sense of the playback sound will be weakened.

separation degree of left and right signals: the mutual leakage between left and right signals is called separation degree of left and right signals.

It is shown as follows in figures:  
**SE = 20lg x [el (or ER) / ER (or EL)]**

Se resolution, expressed in db;  
When the EL (or ER) transmitter has only l (or R) channel input audio voltage modulation, the left (or right) output of the demodulator is v;  
When Er (or EL) transmitter only has R (or L) channel to input audio voltage modulation, the right (or left) output of demodulator is v.

## Dynamic range
Dynamic range refers to the logarithm of the ratio between the maximum undistorted output power and the system noise output power when the audio system replays, and also refers to the relative ratio between the brightest and darkest parts of the output image of a multimedia hard disk player. The unit is dB. Generally, the dynamic range of sound system with better performance is above 100 dB.

Dynamic range refers to the ratio of the maximum signal to the minimum signal that the device can process. This concept is easy to be confused with the concept of "signal-to-noise ratio", so what is the difference between them? It is understandable that the signal smaller than the noise amplitude cannot be restored correctly, but some devices can cut off the noise and small signal from some links when there is no signal or the signal is very low, so as to get a better signal-to-noise ratio index (this is the basic principle of "dynamic noise reduction"). At this time, the small signal can not be processed correctly, and the dynamic range measurement can avoid such artificial optimization. The measurement of dynamic range is to use a small signal (generally - 60dB / 1000Hz sine wave) to be transmitted to the equipment, then filter out the signal, measure the noise and harmonic level of other frequencies, and then compare with the maximum signal, the result is dynamic range.

It can be predicted that the dynamic range is generally lower than the signal-to-noise ratio, but in the case of no special circuit or software to deal with the noise, the difference between the two is generally small, so they can refer to each other. The results of the dynamic range test are shown in the figure. There are no harmonics larger than noise, so the dynamic range and signal-to-noise ratio are basically the same.

It should be pointed out that the measured dynamic range is different from the "theoretical" dynamic range. For example, most of the current digital audio sources are marked with the theoretical value that can be restored by digital signals. For example, the dynamic range of CD is 96dB, and the DVD can reach 144db with 24bit recording. In fact, due to the limitation of analog devices, such an index is impossible to achieve. You just need to test the noise level. But at present, most of the post production of audio-visual programs are processed by computer. In many aspects of the processing process, high bit can avoid signal degradation as far as possible. (in fact, it may even be processed with 48 bit quantization!)

## Channel imbalance
Stereo balance indicates the gain difference between the left and right channels in stereo playback system. If the imbalance is too large, the sound image location of the replayed stereo will deviate. Generally, the stereo balance of high quality sound system should be less than 1dB.

## S/N SNR
Signal to noise ratio, which represents the decibel difference between signal and noise level, expressed in S / N or SNR (DB). The influence of noise frequency and signal strength on human ear is different. Generally, the human ear is most sensitive to the noise of 4 ~ 8kHz, and the weak signal is more affected by the noise than the strong signal. For example, SNR > 70dB is required for hi fi audio, and SNR > 90dB is required for CD player.

The signal to noise ratio is also known as the signal to noise ratio, which is usually expressed as S / n. No matter for any audio product, SNR is an important parameter. Signal to noise ratio (SNR) refers to the ratio of the reproduction of sound source by sound system to the new noise produced by the whole system. The noise mainly includes thermal noise, AC noise, mechanical noise and so on. Generally, this index is expressed in dB, which is the logarithm ratio of the rated output power of the playback signal to the output power of the system noise without signal input. The higher the signal-to-noise ratio is, the better the audio product is. The higher the signal-to-noise ratio of the device is, the less noise it produces. For example, the signal-to-noise ratio of CD players can reach more than 90dB, and that of high-end players can reach more than 110dB.

Audio signal-to-noise ratio refers to the ratio of normal sound signal strength to noise signal strength when audio equipment plays. When the signal-to-noise ratio is low and the small signal is input, the noise is serious, and the sound in the whole range obviously becomes turbid and unclear, and the sound quality is seriously affected. The SNR is expressed by the logarithm of the ratio of useful signal power (or voltage) to noise power (or voltage). The unit thus calculated is called bell. In practice, because the unit of bell is too large, one tenth of it is used as the unit of calculation, which is called "decibel". For portable DVD, SNR should be above 70dB at least.
