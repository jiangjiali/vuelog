## 牙买加体系（1976——至今）
> 1976年，IMF“国际货币制度临时委员会”在牙买加召开会议，并达成《牙买加协议》。同年4月，IMF理事会通过了IMF第二次修正案，从而形成了国际货币关系的新格局。

## 主要内容
* 1、浮动汇率合法化；
* 2、黄金非货币化，取消黄金官价，各会员国央行可按市场价格自由进行黄金交易；
* 3、提高SDR（特别提款权）的国际储备地位；
* 4、扩大对发展中国家的资金融通；
* 5、增加会员国的基金份额。

## 主要运行特征
* 1、多元化的国际储备货币体系，美元依然是主导货币，但是欧元和SDR的地位越来越受到重视。
* 2、多元化的汇率制度安排，除了固定汇率和浮动汇率制度之外，还有多种弹性不同的汇率制度安排。
* 3、多元化的国际收支调节方式，可以通过汇率机制、对商品贸易和资本流动实施管制等方式调节国际收支。

## 对牙买加体系的评价
### 对世界经济发展的积极作用
* 1、多元化的储备体系基本上摆脱了布雷顿森林体系时期基准货币国与其依附国相互牵连的弊端，并在一定程度上解决了“特里芬悖论”。
* 2、以主要货币汇率浮动为主的多种汇率安排体系能够比较灵活地适应世界经济形势多变的状况；自由的汇率安排能使各国充分考虑本国的宏观经济条件，并使宏观经济政策更具独立性和有效性。
* 3、多种国际收支调节机制并存，各种调节机制相互补充，比较能适应各国经济发展水平相差悬殊，各国发展模式、政策目标和客观经济环境都不相同的特点。

### 存在的问题
* 1、汇率纪律荡然无存。浮动汇率加剧了世界性通货膨胀，汇率的频繁波动不仅影响对外贸易和资本流动，而且使发展中国家的外汇储备和外债问题都变得复杂化；
* 2、造成储备货币管理的复杂性；
* 3、缺乏有效的国际收支调节机制。

## Jamaica System (1976-present)
> In 1976, the IMF "Interim Committee on the International Monetary System" held a meeting in Jamaica and reached the "Jamaica Agreement." In April of the same year, the IMF Council passed the second amendment of the IMF, thus forming a new pattern of international currency relations.

## main content
* 1. Legalization of floating exchange rates;
* 2. Gold is demonetized, the official price of gold is cancelled, and the central banks of member states can freely trade gold at market prices;
* 3. Improve the international reserve status of SDR (Special Drawing Rights);
* 4. Expand financial access to developing countries;
* 5. Increase the fund shares of member countries.

## Main operating characteristics
* 1. With a diversified international reserve currency system, the US dollar is still the dominant currency, but the status of the euro and SDR is increasingly being valued.
* 2. Diversified exchange rate system arrangements, in addition to fixed exchange rate and floating exchange rate systems, there are also multiple exchange rate arrangements with different flexibility.
* 3. Diversified methods of adjustment of balance of payments, which can adjust the balance of payments through exchange rate mechanisms, control of commodity trade and capital flows, etc.

## Evaluation of Jamaica System
### Positive effect on world economic development
* 1. The diversified reserve system basically got rid of the drawbacks of the mutual involvement between the base currency country and its dependent countries during the Bretton Woods system, and to a certain extent solved the "Triffin Paradox".
* 2. A variety of exchange rate arrangements based on the exchange rate fluctuations of major currencies can more flexibly adapt to the changing conditions of the world economy; free exchange rate arrangements enable countries to fully consider their own macroeconomic conditions and make their macroeconomic policies better Independent and effective.
* 3. A variety of balance of payments adjustment mechanisms coexist, and various adjustment mechanisms complement each other, and are more adaptable to the wide disparity in economic development levels of various countries, and the characteristics of different development models, policy objectives and objective economic environments of various countries.

### Problems
* 1. There is no exchange rate discipline. Floating exchange rates have exacerbated global inflation. Frequent exchange rate fluctuations not only affect foreign trade and capital flows, but also complicate the foreign exchange reserves and foreign debt issues of developing countries;
* 2. Complicated management of reserve currency;
* 3. Lack of an effective balance of payments adjustment mechanism.
