## 1、目标

　　如果你想加薪,但公司却无法给你加薪——谈判失败。

　　实际上,你真正的目标应该是过上更好的生活。

　　因此,也许公司可以和你连名签署一笔贷款,让你住上一个条件更好、每月还贷更少的房子；或者,公司可以给你更多的休假时间,让你能够在外做兼职。

　　什么是目标?目标就是,你在谈判过程结束时,想要的东西。

　　目标只有一个,可需求却有很多,这些需求可以通过这一目标得到满足。也就是说,这些需求是实现这一目标的各种原因。

　　你在谈判中的所有行为,都应明确无误地使你更接近自己在谈判中的目标——不要努力去建立人际关系,除非这种关系能让你更接近自己的目标。不要给予或收集信息,除非这会让你更接近目标。

## 2、对方

　　戴蒙德的学生看中的一套衣服标价500美元折后价350美元。他将衣服拿到收银台时,收银台只有一位服务员,正忙于回应顾客的各种要求和投诉。

　　这位学生就在那里等着,直到其他顾客全部走光。

　　他先是就其他顾客的行为,向收银员表示了歉意。接着,他说,她忙了一整天一定很疲惫,其他顾客拿她出气这不公平。然后,他强调了这套衣服的现有折扣,接着询问是否还能再给予一些优惠。

　　最终,他额外得到了14%的折扣。

　　这个案例告诉我们,在整个谈判中,你是最无足轻重的一个人,最重要的人是对方——成功的谈判者会认真观察对方,将注意力放在对方身上,最终更有效地实现自己的目标。也就是说,你要摸清你对面的人,此时此刻的情绪和处境状况,即使他与你是老相识,即使他是你的配偶。

　　再说具体点,那就是,要让对方将你想要的东西给你,关键是要尊重对方。通常,尊重对方会给你意想不到和获利丰厚的回报。

　　下次,当服务生或客户服务代表等服务提供者,犯了错误或没有准确满足你的要求时,不要责骂他们或对他们态度恶劣。这样做无助于你实现自己的目标。相反,要尊重他们,承认他们有能力做得更好。这与人们通常暴跳如雷的反应相反,但却很有效。

　　关注他人还有一层含义,即当你正在和一个团队的代表进行谈判的时候,你的注意力应该放在这个团队的个体成员身上,而不是他们所代表的公司或文化。

　　谈判不顺利时,想想“第三方”——当你需要对某人施加影响、而又自认为没有足够的影响力的时候,想一想对对方而言很重要的人还有谁,以及更容易受你影响的人又是谁。

　　无论是重视对方还是第三方,目的都是找出谈判的决策者——有多少人,浪费了生命中大把的时间与人谈判,结果却所谈非人?

　　戴蒙德特别警告说,不要试图利用权力去实现目标,这会传递出紧张、争斗的信息,强迫对方做出违背意愿的事,最终只能激起对方的反感和报复。

## 3、不等价

　　如果你真的非要拥有跑车,那你妻子也应该得到她爱好的某样东西。如果丈夫帮忙打理花园,他看足球比赛的时候妻子就不应该发牢骚。妻子收拾客厅,丈夫就打扫车库。丈夫和好友们打牌,妻子就可以外出度过一个愉快的“女生”之夜。

　　这就是不等价交易,也就是,将一方重视而另一方不重视的东西拿出来进行交换。

　　不等价交易的背后,有一个关键的驱动力:无形资产。即除金钱以外对对方同样具有价值的东西。

　　对那些与交易无关的需求思考得越广泛,整个交易附加的价值也就越大。

　　费城一家大公司的总裁,曾为与他有着20年业务关系的最重要的商业客户做了一件最重要的事情,即在一个星期六的晚上到费城机场去接这位客户的母亲。他的行为与任何交易无关,但此后却对他的每一笔交易都产生了永久性的影响。

　　2001年1月,戴蒙德的心脏病发作了两次。世界上最好的心脏搭桥外科医生韦恩·伊索姆的手术时间表已经排到了几个月之后。戴蒙德联系伊索姆医生的唯一方式,只有电子邮件。

　　在病床上,戴蒙德开始研究伊索姆医生的各种信息,试图寻找某种联系。

　　当时,伊索姆医生研究的课题是小动脉胆固醇的积聚。戴蒙德有小动脉。

　　于是,戴蒙德给伊索姆医生写去了一封邮件。

　　此外,戴蒙德还托人联系了另外一位心脏病专家迈克尔·沃尔克,托他给伊索姆医生打了电话。

　　戴蒙德获得了伊索姆医生的时间。伊索姆为他做了手术,手术非常成功。

　　通过第三方找到的那位德高望重的心脏病专家,给伊索姆打电话,的确起了一些作用。但伊索姆却说原因不仅于此:戴蒙德是曾关心他研究的为数不多的患者之一——戴蒙德和伊索姆建立了一种“私人关系。”

　　对谈判而言,这个事例的意义在于:只要确保建立起某种私人关系,任何一件产品或任何一项服务都不再只是一件“商品”,它是你的神经元、你的经历、你的时间、你的努力、对你必须与其进行交易的对方的兴趣。这会让你所提供的东西与众不同。这些无形之物可以充实他人的生活,可以让交易更加成功,可以让每一个人都获得更多。

　　但,在某些情况下,向他人提供某些特定的无形资产是一种不道德的行为,例如医药公司给医生送礼,向政府人员行贿等。你要找的无形资产必须合法。

## 4、准则

　　戴蒙德的一个学生走进麦当劳买薯条,薯条有些湿软,学生想换一份新鲜的。服务员说,5分钟后就关门了,言下之意是无法提供。

　　学生拿起柜台上的一张麦当劳宣传单,上面说麦当劳的食物在整个营业期间都是绝对新鲜的,它并没有说,这一点在闭店前5分钟可以失效。

　　学生指出了服务员违背准则。服务员缴械投降,随后新鲜的薯条被端了出来——利用对方的准则,这是戴蒙德最推崇的谈判策略之一。

　　这种技巧,对那些难对付的谈判者尤为有效。

　　所以,如果客户服务代表不予帮助或对你无礼,可以对他们说:“你们的广告上说,客户服务代表要始终竭诚为顾客服务。我很好奇——你们所说的和现在这种情况一致吗?”

　　某些情况下,如果没有先前的准则供你利用,想办法确定一些在谈判中对方会接受的准则。

　　比如,一名年轻的经理在爱马仕法国店,看中了一条标价500美元优惠降价后为250美元的围巾,准备送给妻子作为生日礼物。但店员却称,降价商品不提供包装服务。

　　这名经理没有像大多数人一样怒不可遏(大多数人也因此一无所得)。他问:“如果我付全价500美元购买这条围巾,你就会把它包装成礼品吗?”“当然。”店员说。

　　这名经理接着说:“也就是说,爱马仕要收取250美元作为礼品包装费?”

　　最后,这名经理买的围巾被包装成礼品了吗?那是当然！

　　假设你正在提一个完全合乎情理的要求,而在电话另一端的客服代表却完全不通情理。他(她)事实上是在违反公司的准则。你可以借助第三方的力量问对方:“如果贵公司的首席执行官亲自听这个电话,他会赞成您这样做吗?”

　　如果对方说:“你是在用准则吓唬我吗?”你可以回答说:“当然！我根据你们精心制定的准则来作决定,这有什么错吗?”在这里,你已将讨论对方的准则变成了问题焦点。“我不过是在要求贵公司遵循自己的准则,不是吗?”

　　如果对方不想回答你有关准则的问题,那又该怎么办呢?那就问对方你所提的这个问题本身是否有问题。这样一来,对方回答这个问题的过程就变成了一个有关准则的问题。

　　当机票代售人员对你说,改签机票要收费100美元的时候,问一下该公司史上对该项规定是否有过破例情况。如果有,试着让自己符合其中的一种例外情况。

　　你要小心的是:如果在周围有很多人的情况下,要求对方为你破例,那你往往会无法如愿。因为,这会增加对方作出决定的难度。如果被其他人无意中听到,他们也会要求破例。

<!-- next -->

## 5、沟通

　　大多数人在谈判一开始就摆出各项事实。然而,在这个世界上,大多数人对事实和理性都不感兴趣。在谈判中,我们应该这样开始:对方准备好要听我说话了吗?要想知道答案,你必须了解对方脑海中的画面:他们的观点和感受、对你的看法以及对世界的看法。

　　比如,试试这样的开头:“嗨,你的这栋房子实在太漂亮了,你在这儿住多久了?”

　　解释你的观点是你应该做的最后一件事。首先,你应该先了解对方的观点。

　　了解对方观点的一个好办法是提问。在谈判中,提问要远比陈述更有力量。

　　陈述会让你受制于自己所说的话,无法帮你获取任何信息,而且还会授人以柄,让你成为众矢之的。换句话说,提问不会让你受到限制,通常还会帮你获取信息,如果你愿意,还能授你以柄。提问可以让对方将注意力放在他们自己身上。

　　所以,试着将你的陈述变成一个个问句。不要说:“这不公平！”试着说:“你觉得这公平吗?”不要对你的儿子说:“把你的房间收拾干净！”试着说:“你能告诉我,为什么你的房间这么乱呢?”

　　许多人想当然地认为,提问往往会充满敌意。事实上,提问的方式可以各种各样。戴蒙德最喜欢的一种策略是:“帮帮我吧,我有些迷惑……”这是一种强有力的提问方式——向对方寻求帮助。

　　下面有几个有效沟通的基本原则,值得学习:

　　★经常总结

　　要经常对你所听到的内容进行总结,然后用自己的话再给对方说一遍。这样做是尊重对方,还可确保你们双方的意见仍然保持一致。

　　★进行角色互换

　　戴蒙德的一名学生被花旗银行录用,一同被录用的大约还有50名工商管理硕士毕业生。

　　这名学生不满足于自己的薪酬,希望薪酬更高些。

　　戴蒙德问他的目标是什么?他说,希望在50名新入职员工中脱颖而出,这样在公司就能晋升更快。他还说,想让录用他的副总裁当他的导师。

　　戴蒙德建议,一步一步地实现目标。“首先,你的目标是脱颖而出,而大部分人目标是加薪。那么,要求加薪怎么能让你脱颖而出呢?”

　　学生回答,看看自己的行动是否与自己的目标一致。去年夏天,这名学生曾在这个副总裁手下实习过。他说,这位副总裁刚刚制订了一项新计划,目的是让50名新录用的员工,从9月份开始轮流进入各部门。对人员这样部署尚属首次。

　　戴蒙德说:“现在把你放在副总裁的位置上,想想他有什么希望,又害怕什么?你怎样才能帮到他?”

　　这名学生进行了角色互换。然后,他对电话给副总裁,诚恳地感谢副总裁对他的录用,说他希望副总裁能够做自己的导师。作为回报,他愿意在未来10个月里竭尽所能地帮助副总裁。他主动要求承担采访和调研工作以及其他任何必要的行政工作。

　　最终,副总裁给他带来了好消息。一是,立刻发给这名学生15000美元奖金；二是,让他下个月参加花旗银行全球董事会议,见一下花旗集团的董事长和首席执行官。

　　人们往往无法表达自己的感情。你的任务就是找出隐藏在人们言论背后的真正想法。如何才能做到这一点呢?可通过如下方式:努力找出有关对方的更多信息、将自己置于对方的位置、努力看清对方脑海中的画面。

　　★平心静气

　　如果有人对你说“我恨你”,正确的回应应该是“告诉我为什么”。只有了解了对方的想法或感受,才能更好地说服他们。

　　同理,“你是个白痴吗?”你的回应不应该是“去你的！”“你才是白痴！”而是“你为什么认为我是个白痴呢?”

　　★寻找不起眼的小信号

　　如果对方说:“我不可能在这个时候为你这样做。”你就应该问:“那你什么时候能这样做呢?”或“还有谁能这样做呢?”

　　如果对方说:“这是我们的标准合同。”你就应该问:“贵方曾有过例外情况?”

　　如果对方说:“我们从来不议价。”你就应该问:“好吧,那你们议什么呢?”

　　要注意对方的每一个用词、每一个语调的变化和每一个举动。

　　★共同需求

　　一个下雪天,戴蒙德有些沮丧地开始了与某人的谈判:“这雪怎么了?”对方回答说:“事实上,我非常喜欢雪,我的兴趣是滑雪。”

　　戴蒙德接着问道:“那你觉得热天怎么样?”

　　戴蒙德为什么要这样问呢?戴蒙德正在努力寻找一个双方共同的敌人。

　　同仇敌忾可以缩小谈判双方的距离,使谈判更加顺利。这就是人们总是爱抱怨天气的原因。

　　同仇敌忾可以顺利地建立起人际关系,使双方都处于一种有利的位置。

　　正是由于这个原因,人们才会经常半开玩笑地抱怨律师,抱怨交通,抱怨官僚主义等。

　　找出双方的共同需求是一个很好的技巧(尽管它对心理的影响更小),如果谈判一开始就能将其找出,也会取得不错的效果。

## 6、差异

　　阿努普·米斯拉是一家房地产开发公司的创始人。一位客户认为,他提供的43万美元的建筑服务包价格偏高,但这位客户又不告诉阿努普·米斯拉他能接受的费用价格。

　　最后,阿努普·米斯拉让客户对“建筑服务包”一词进行了界定。

　　原来,客户想要的服务,比阿努普·米斯拉提供的服务,要少很多。

　　由于服务范围缩小了一半,最终确定的费用为23万美元。双方分歧得以消除。

　　导致谈判失败的最大原因,是沟通失败。而导致沟通失败的最大一个原因是误解——就好比,两个人看同一幅画,每个人看到的内容是不一样的。

　　如何解决沟通失败和观点存在差异这些问题呢?

　　当你与某人发生冲突的时候,问问自己下列问题:
　　(1)我的看法是什么?
　　(2)对方的看法是什么?
　　(3)是否存在观点不一致的情况?
　　(4)如果是,原因是什么?

　　这里有两句话,其所用词语完全相同。第一句:“我要去纽约市。你要去哪儿?”第二句:“你要去哪儿?我要去纽约市。”经验表明,与第一句相比,第二句更容易为对方所接受。

　　如果你首先询问对方的观点是什么,这表明你很重视他们,对方会因此更有兴趣倾听你想说的话。

　　两句话,词语相同,语序不同,意义就不一样了。这也是为什么打断别人说话通常是毫无意义的,即使对方的话被打断了,其脑海中的思想却并未中断。

## 7、循序渐进

　　戴蒙德在哥伦比亚商学院的一名学生,在餐厅点了一份纯真玛丽鸡尾酒(血腥玛丽不加伏特加),结果被告知这种鸡尾酒无法调制。

　　“你们有番茄汁吗?”她平静地问道。

　　“有”,女服务员回答。

　　她接着又以同样的方式逐一问对方有没有塔巴斯科辣椒酱、辣酱油和冰。

　　最后,她得到了纯真玛丽鸡尾酒。

　　在谈判中,应该一步一步地带领对方,从熟悉的内容到不熟悉的内容。情况越复杂,迈的步子要越小,所需步骤要越多。

　　循序渐进在所有的谈判中,都是重要的。在处理人际关系的谈判中,则更为重要。

　　戴蒙德的学生林甘和父母难以相处,她尤其讨厌冬天回家,房子特别冷。上过谈判课后,她开始尝试和父母沟通,了解到采暖费的昂贵,且明白自己抱怨房子太冷的行为,令父母受到了伤害。她通过称赞父母勤俭持家,表达了对父母的尊重,进行了情感补偿,而后建议父母先给一个房间供暖,所以不必支付太多的采暖费。最终,她和父母互相谅解,循序渐进的方案配合情感补偿,实现了林甘的目标,也挽救了破碎的人际关系。

## 1. Goal

　　 If you want a raise, but the company cannot give you a raise-the negotiation fails.

　　 Actually, your real goal should be to live a better life.

Therefore, maybe the company can sign a loan with you, allowing you to live in a house with better conditions and less monthly loan repayment; or, the company can give you more vacation time so that you can work part-time outside. .

　　What is a goal? A goal is what you want at the end of the negotiation process.

　　 There is only one goal, but there are many needs. These needs can be met through this goal. In other words, these needs are various reasons for achieving this goal.

　　 All your actions in the negotiation should clearly and unmistakably bring you closer to your goal in the negotiation-don't try to establish interpersonal relationships, unless this relationship brings you closer to your goals. Don't give or collect information unless it brings you closer to your goal.

## 2. The other party

　　 The set of clothes that Diamond’s students fancy is priced at US$500 after discounting it for US$350. When he took the clothes to the checkout counter, there was only one waiter at the checkout counter, who was busy responding to customer requests and complaints.

　　 The student waited there until all the other customers were gone.

　　He first apologized to the cashier for the behavior of other customers. Then, he said that she must be exhausted all day long and it is unfair for other customers to vent her anger. Then, he emphasized the existing discount for this suit, and then asked if there were any more discounts.

　　 In the end, he got an additional 14% discount.

This case tells us that in the entire negotiation, you are the most insignificant person, and the most important person is the other party-a successful negotiator will carefully observe the other party, focus on the other party, and finally achieve their own goals more effectively. aims. In other words, you have to find out the mood and situation of the person opposite you at this moment, even if he and you are old acquaintances, even if he is your spouse.

　　 To be more specific, that is, to let the other person give you what you want, the key is to respect the other person. Usually, respecting the other party will give you unexpected and lucrative returns.

　　 Next time, when service providers such as waiters or customer service representatives make mistakes or fail to meet your requirements accurately, don't scold them or treat them badly. Doing so will not help you achieve your goals. Instead, respect them and admit that they are capable of doing better. This is the opposite of people's usual furious reaction, but it is very effective.

　　Focus on others has another meaning, that is, when you are negotiating with a team representative, your attention should be on the individual members of the team, not on the company or culture they represent.

When the negotiation is not going well, think about the "third party"-when you need to influence someone and you think you don't have enough influence, think about who else is important to the other party, and Who are the people more easily influenced by you?

　　 Regardless of whether you value the other party or the third party, the purpose is to find the decision-maker for the negotiation-how many people waste a lot of time in their lives negotiating with others, but the result is inhuman?

　　 Diamond warned in particular that you should not try to use power to achieve your goals. This will send a message of tension and struggle, forcing the other party to do things against their will, and ultimately only arouse the other's resentment and revenge.

## 3. Not equivalent

　　 If you really have to own a sports car, then your wife should also get something she likes. If the husband helps take care of the garden, his wife should not complain when he is watching a football game. The wife cleaned the living room, and the husband cleaned the garage. When the husband and his friends play cards, the wife can go out and spend a pleasant "girl" night.

　　 This is an unequal transaction, that is, the exchange of things that one party values ​​while the other party does not.

　　 There is a key driving force behind unequal transactions: intangible assets. That is, things that are also valuable to the other party in addition to money.

　　 The more you think about the needs that are not related to the transaction, the greater the value added to the entire transaction.

　　 The president of a large Philadelphia company once did one of the most important things for the most important business customer with whom he had 20 years of business relationship, that is, to pick up the customer's mother at the Philadelphia airport on a Saturday night. His behavior has nothing to do with any transaction, but since then it has a permanent impact on every transaction of his.

　　 In January 2001, Diamond suffered two heart attacks. Wayne Isom, the world’s best bypass surgeon,’s surgery schedule is already a few months away. Diamond's only way to contact Dr. Isom is by email.

　　On the hospital bed, Diamond began to research all kinds of information about Dr. Isom, trying to find some kind of connection.

　　 At that time, Dr. Isom’s research topic was the accumulation of arteriole cholesterol. Diamond has small arteries.

　　 So Diamond wrote an email to Dr. Isom.

　　 In addition, Diamond also asked someone to contact another cardiologist, Michael Walker, and asked him to call Dr. Isom.

　　 Diamond got the time of Doctor Isom. Isom performed an operation on him, which was very successful.

　　 The well-respected cardiologist found through a third party, and called Isom, did have some effect. But Isom said that the reason is not only here: Diamond is one of the few patients who have ever cared about his research-Diamond and Isom have established a kind of "personal relationship."

For negotiation, the significance of this case is: as long as a certain personal relationship is established, any product or any service is no longer just a "commodity", it is your neuron, your experience, Your time, your efforts, your interest in the other party you have to deal with. This will make what you offer is different. These intangibles can enrich the lives of others, make transactions more successful, and allow everyone to get more.

　　 However, under certain circumstances, it is an unethical act to provide certain intangible assets to others, such as giving gifts to doctors by pharmaceutical companies and bribery to government officials. The intangible assets you are looking for must be legal.

## 4. Guidelines

　　 A student of Diamond walked into McDonald’s to buy fries. The fries were a little soggy, and the students wanted to get a fresh one. The waiter said that it would close in 5 minutes, which meant that it could not be provided.

　　 The student picked up a McDonald’s leaflet on the counter. It said that McDonald’s food was absolutely fresh throughout the business period. It did not say that this could be invalidated 5 minutes before closing.

　　 The student pointed out that the waiter violated the guidelines. The waiter disarmed and surrendered, and then the fresh fries were brought out-using the other party's guidelines, which is one of Diamond's most respected negotiation strategies.

　　 This technique is especially effective for those difficult negotiators.

Therefore, if the customer service representative is not helpful or rude to you, you can say to them: "Your advertisement says that the customer service representative must always serve customers wholeheartedly. I'm very curious-what you said is the same as it is now. Is the situation consistent?"

　　 In some cases, if there are no previous guidelines for you to use, find a way to determine some criteria that the other party will accept in the negotiation.

　　 For example, a young manager at the Hermès store in France took a fancy to a scarf with a price tag of US$500 and a discount of US$250, and prepared to give it to his wife as a birthday gift. But the clerk said that packaging services are not provided for reduced-price products.

　　 This manager is not as angry as most people (most people get nothing for this). He asked: "If I paid the full price of $500 for this scarf, would you wrap it as a gift?" "Of course," the clerk said.

　　 The manager went on to say: "In other words, Hermes will charge $250 as a gift wrapping fee?"

　　 Finally, was the scarf bought by this manager packaged as a gift? Of course!

　　 Suppose you are making a completely reasonable request, and the customer service representative on the other end of the phone is completely unreasonable. He (she) is actually violating the company's guidelines. You can use the power of a third party to ask the other party: "If the CEO of your company listens to this call in person, will he approve of this?"

If the other person says: "Are you using guidelines to scare me?" You can answer: "Of course! I make decisions based on your carefully formulated guidelines. Is there anything wrong with this?" Here, you have discussed the other party's The guidelines became the focus of the problem. "I'm just asking your company to follow its own guidelines, am I not?"

　　If the other party does not want to answer your question about the guidelines, what should you do? Then ask the other party if the question you are asking is inherently problematic. In this way, the process of answering this question by the other party has become a question of standards.

　　 When the ticket sales staff tells you that there is a charge of $100 for changing the ticket, ask if there has been an exception to this rule in the history of the company. If so, try to fit one of the exceptions.

　　 You have to be careful: If you ask the other party to make an exception for you when there are many people around, you will often fail to do so. Because it will increase the difficulty for the other party to make a decision. If someone else overheard, they will also ask for an exception.

<!-- next -->

## 5. Communication

　　 Most people present the facts at the beginning of the negotiation. However, in this world, most people are not interested in facts and reason. In the negotiation, we should start like this: Is the other party ready to listen to me? To know the answer, you must understand the picture in the other's mind: their views and feelings, their views of you, and their views of the world.

　　 For example, try this opening: "Hey, your house is so beautiful. How long have you lived here?"

　　 Explaining your point is the last thing you should do. First of all, you should first understand the other person's point of view.

　　A good way to understand the other person’s point of view is to ask questions. In negotiations, questions are far more powerful than statements.

　　 Statements will make you subject to what you say, and cannot help you obtain any information. It will also give others a handle to make you a target. In other words, asking questions will not restrict you, and will usually help you obtain information, and give you a handle if you want. Asking questions allows the other person to focus on themselves.

　　 So, try to turn your statements into questions. Don't say: "It's not fair!" Try to say: "Do you think it's fair?" Don't say to your son: "Clean up your room!" Try to say: "Can you tell me why yours Is the room so messy?"

　　 Many people take it for granted that asking questions is often hostile. In fact, there are various ways of asking questions. One of Diamond's favorite strategies is: "Help me, I'm a little confused..." This is a powerful way of asking questions-asking for help.

　　 There are a few basic principles of effective communication that are worth learning:

　　★We always summarize

　　 Always summarize what you have heard, and then use your own words to tell the other party again. This is to respect each other and also to ensure that both of you are still in agreement.

　　★Swap roles

　　 One of Diamond's students was hired by Citibank, and about 50 MBA graduates were also hired.

　　 This student is not satisfied with his salary, and hopes it will be higher.

　　 Diamond asked what his goal is? He said that he hopes to stand out among the 50 new hires so that he can be promoted faster in the company. He also said that he wanted the vice president who hired him to be his mentor.

　　 Diamond suggested to achieve the goal step by step. "First of all, your goal is to stand out, and most people's goal is to get a raise. So how can asking for a raise make you stand out?"

　　 The student replied to see if their actions are consistent with their goals. Last summer, the student had an internship under the vice president. He said that the vice president has just drawn up a new plan to allow 50 newly hired employees to enter various departments in rotation starting in September. This is the first time for personnel to be deployed in this way.

　　 Diamond said: "Now put you in the position of vice president, think about what he has hope for and what is afraid of? How can you help him?"

　　 The student changed roles. Then, he called the vice president and sincerely thanked the vice president for hiring him, saying that he hoped that the vice president could be his mentor. In return, he is willing to do his best to help the vice president in the next 10 months. He actively asked to undertake interviews and research work and any other necessary administrative work.

　　 Finally, the vice president brought him good news. One is to immediately give this student a $15,000 bonus; the other is to ask him to attend the Citibank Global Board of Directors next month to meet with the chairman and CEO of Citigroup.

　　People often cannot express their feelings. Your task is to find out the real ideas behind people's speech. How can we do this? You can do this by trying to find out more information about the other person, putting yourself in the other person's position, and trying to see the picture in the other person's mind.

　　★Calm down

　　 If someone says "I hate you" to you, the correct response should be "tell me why". Only by understanding the other person's thoughts or feelings can we better persuade them.

　　 Similarly, "Are you an idiot?" Your response should not be "Fuck you!" "You are an idiot!" but "Why do you think I am an idiot?"

　　★Looking for unremarkable small signals

　　 If the other person says: "I can't do this for you at this time." You should ask: "Then when can you do this?" or "Who else can do this?"

　　 If the other party says: "This is our standard contract." You should ask: "Have you ever had an exception?"

　　 If the other person says: "We never bargain." You should ask: "Well, what are you talking about?"

　　 Pay attention to every word, every change of intonation and every action of the other party.

　　★Common needs

　　 One snowy day, Diamond started a negotiation with someone with some frustration: "What's wrong with this snow?" The other party replied, "In fact, I like snow very much, and my hobby is skiing."

　　 Diamond then asked: "Then what do you think of a hot day?"

　　 Why does Diamond ask this? Diamond is trying to find a common enemy on both sides.

　　 The same hatred can narrow the distance between the two parties in the negotiation and make the negotiation smoother. This is why people always complain about the weather.

　　 The same enemy can successfully establish interpersonal relationships, so that both sides are in a favorable position.

　　 It is for this reason that people often complain about lawyers, traffic, and bureaucracy half-jokingly.

　　 It is a good technique to find out the common needs of both parties (although it has a smaller psychological impact). If you can find them out at the beginning of the negotiation, you will get good results.

## 6. Difference

　　 Anup Misra is the founder of a real estate development company. A client thought that the price of the $430,000 construction service package he provided was too high, but the client did not tell Anup Misra the price he could accept.

　　 Finally, Anup Misra asked the client to define the term "construction service package".

　　 It turns out that the service customers want is much less than that provided by Anup Misra.

　　 As the scope of services has been reduced by half, the final cost is $230,000. The differences between the two sides were eliminated.

　　 The biggest cause of negotiation failure is communication failure. The biggest reason for communication failure is misunderstanding-just like when two people look at the same painting, everyone sees different content.

　　How to solve the problems of communication failure and differences in opinions?

　　 When you have a conflict with someone, ask yourself the following questions:
　　 (1) What is my opinion?
　　 (2) What is the other person's opinion?
　　(3) Are there any disagreements?
　　 (4) If yes, what is the reason?

　　 There are two sentences here, and the words used are exactly the same. The first sentence: "I'm going to New York City. Where are you going?" The second sentence: "Where are you going? I'm going to New York City." Experience shows that the second sentence is easier to do than the first sentence. Accepted by the other party.

　　 If you first ask the other person what their point of view is, it shows that you value them very much and the other person will be more interested in listening to what you want to say.

　　 Two sentences, the words are the same, the word order is different, and the meaning is different. This is why it is usually meaningless to interrupt someone else's speech, even if the other person's words are interrupted, the thoughts in his mind are not interrupted.

## 7, step by step

　　 A student of Diamond at Columbia Business School ordered an innocent Mary cocktail (Bloody Mary without vodka) in the restaurant and was told that this cocktail could not be mixed.

　　 "Do you have tomato juice?" She asked calmly.

　　 "Yes," the waitress replied.

　　 In the same way, she then asked each other if they had Tabasco sauce, hot soy sauce and ice.

　　 Finally, she got the innocent Mary cocktail.
