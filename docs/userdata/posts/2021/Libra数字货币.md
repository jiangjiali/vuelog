title: Libra数字货币
------------------------------------
<!-- zh-CN:+ -->
> Libra，是Facebook新推出的虚拟加密货币。Libra是一种不追求对美元汇率稳定，而追求实际购买力相对稳定的加密数字货币。最初由美元、英镑、欧元和日元这4种法币计价的一篮子低波动性资产作为抵押物。

## 发展历史
* 2019年6月18日，Facebook发布Libra白皮书。

## 主要特征
1. Libra是全球首家大型网络巨头发起的加密币，除了Facebook之外，Visa、Mastercard、Paypal、Uber等大机构都参与其中。特别是Facebook在全球拥有24亿社交网络基础，预计Libra的推广速度，不亚于微信春晚摇红包的推广速度。
2. Libra与一篮子货币的存款或政府债券挂钩，与比特币等没有任何资产支撑的加密币更符合芸芸大众的思维习惯。

## 开发机构
沃尔玛试图创建一个“用于购买和众包工作的开放式价值交换平台”降低用户原本通过银行系统的支付成本。设计上1：1锚定美元，暂定只能在沃尔玛选定的零售商或者合作伙伴处使用，普通用户可以在指定机构兑换美元现金。类似一种体系内的充值卡，但可以产生利息，且未来可能出现信用派生功能。

## 货币类型
市场上的稳定币类型主要分为：
1. 单一法币抵押型稳定币：以Tether为首的基于区块链但又不会发生美元“价格波动”的数字货。USDCoin，TrueUSD等后来者；多元法币抵押型稳定币提高了业务模式的透明度。
2. 数字资产抵押：如DAI，BitUSD，以区块链上的原生资产做超额抵押发行的稳定币，仍然以锚定美元为主。
3. 实物抵押型：DGX等，以黄金作为抵押追求对黄金价格的稳定。
4. 无抵押算法型：Basis，Ampleforth等希望通过算法控制货币的供需平衡，从而实现稳定，但这一概念难以成实现。
5. 负债/权益型：JP．Morgan的JPMCoin，类似传统银行进行信用货币派生的模式。

## 愿景地位
Libra的愿景是作为一款全球性的数字原生货币，集稳定性、低通胀、全球普遍接受和可互换性于一体，推行金融普惠，主打支付和跨境汇款。

Libra 有潜力向Facebook既有的24亿用户群开放，促使他们在全球范围内采用Libra代币开展交易。Facebook将有机会改变变现方式过度依赖广告（98.5%）的现状，并进一步提升其作为数字APP、数字网站和电子商务开源工具提供者的地位。

## 社会影响
作为一个符合互联网时代特点的超越主权范围的加密币，必然会对货币政策、金融监管、金融安全、世界货币格局、甚至国际政治经济竞争格局都会带来不可估量的巨大影响。

美国住房和城市事务委员会主席、众议员Maxine Waters，此前曾呼吁Facebook暂停对Libra的工作，直到国会和监管机构有机会仔细审查该提议。Maxine Waters在写给共和党同僚McHenry的信中表示，Facebook应停止天秤座网络的开发，直到举行听证会，她认为，随着Facebook宣布创建加密货币以来，其不受限制的扩张，并计划将其覆盖范围扩展到其用户的生活中。然而对于加密货币没有明确的监管框架来为投资者、消费者和经济提供强有力的保护。

McHenry则回应表示，关于项目的范围和规模以及它如何符合我们的全球金融监管框架，存在许多悬而未决的问题。作为政策制定者，我们有责任了解天秤座项目。我们需要超越谣言和猜测，并提供一个评估该项目的论坛及其对全球金融体系的潜在的巨大影响。

### “Libra”们的影响至少有三方面：
1. 重塑支付行业：新一批玩家将在数字世界搭建一个新舞台。当前有一场争论经久不息，那就是“谁最终将会成为移动市场的关键金融服务提供商？”而Libra 生态系统则可能会导致这些争论变得过时，直接抢了大部分金融中介机构的饭碗。
2. 降低部分主权政府的资本管制能力，影响新兴市场国家的货币主权地位。作为一篮子国际货币和金融资产，加密货币Libra 具有协助企业、个人前往资金安全港渠道（“资金安全出逃”）的潜力。有些渠道和市场会以Libra 为计价货币，这可能会突破央行采用基于资本管制的货币政策，尤其是在资本项目还未完全开放的新兴市场国家。稳定币和加密资产在某些国家同样发挥这一作用，在某些采用资本管制的国家，数字货币交易所的汇率与官方外汇牌价之间的价差就可说明这一点。
3. 可能会强化美元统治地位，挤压人民币国际化的空间。因为美元是国际贸易、投资、储备中需求量最大的高信用等级货币，且实测数据表明美元在过去50年间通货膨胀的波动率是最低的，即拥有最稳定的购买力。目前多数商业机构发行的数字货币实质上是在借用美元的购买力，若这些数字货币得到广泛使用，将挤压人民币国际化的空间。

## 监管建议
“Libra ”们需要在政府合法合规的监管框架下才能有序发展。具体建议如下：
1. 建议中央政府确立区块链行业与数字稳定币在未来金融体系中的核心战略地位。
2. 建议在一定范围内建立监管沙盒机制，试点基于数字稳定币的支付结算服务。
3. 建议允许民营企业发行数字稳定币，开发跨境支付结算系统。

> Libra, is Facebook's newly launched virtual cryptocurrency. Libra is an encrypted digital currency that does not pursue the stability of the exchange rate against the US dollar, but pursues a relatively stable actual purchasing power. Initially, a basket of low-volatility assets denominated in four legal currencies, the US dollar, the British pound, the Euro and the Japanese yen, was used as collateral.

## Development History
* On June 18, 2019, Facebook released the Libra white paper.
* On July 16, 2019, the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs held a hearing on Facebook’s new cryptocurrency Libra. At the hearing, the digital currency and data privacy issues raised by Facebook were reviewed.
* On July 17, 2019, the US House of Representatives Financial Services Committee held a hearing on Facebook virtual currency. This is the second hearing on Facebook's cryptocurrency Libra.
* Libra will be launched in 2020.
* On September 13, 2019, the French Ministry of Finance stated that France and Germany have agreed to boycott the Libra cryptocurrency owned by Facebook.
* On October 5, 2019, PayPal announced that it would give up participating in Facebook's cryptocurrency Libra.
* In October 2019, foreign media reported that the five European Union countries, led by France, are joining forces to boycott Libra’s entry into the European market and are also preparing to ask Facebook to abandon the project. On October 24, Zuckerberg attended a hearing in the US Congress, saying that Libra aims to help disadvantaged groups establish financial accounts.
* In mid-April 2020, there are several changes in the 2.0 version of the white paper released by the Libra project, including no longer mentioning "currency without borders", but using the term "global payment system", positioning it as a settlement currency to avoid challenging currencies Sovereignty, etc., while expressly referring to the management of currency funds to deal with the risk of possible runs.
* On May 15, 2020, Temasek, an international investment company headquartered in Singapore, tweeted that we are very happy to join Libra, and how it has the potential of this blockchain-based digital currency. It is expected to help build a cost-effective global network of retail payment supervision.
* On May 6, 2020, the Libra Association appointed Stewart Levy as its first CEO.
* On September 17, 2020, the Libra Association announced that the Facebook digital cryptocurrency Libra (Libra) project has appointed James Emmet, the former European director of HSBC, to lead Libra’s operations department, responsible for the development and operation of the project’s cryptocurrency payment system.

## Main features
First, Libra is the world's first cryptocurrency initiated by a large online giant. In addition to Facebook, major institutions such as Visa, Mastercard, Paypal, and Uber have participated. In particular, Facebook has a global social network base of 2.4 billion, and it is expected that the promotion speed of Libra is no less than the promotion speed of WeChat Spring Festival Gala.

Second, Libra is linked to a basket of currency deposits or government bonds, and it is more in line with the thinking habits of the general public that it is not supported by any assets such as Bitcoin.

## Development Agency
Wal-Mart is trying to create an "open value exchange platform for purchasing and crowdsourcing work" to reduce users' original payment costs through the banking system. The design is 1:1 anchored to the US dollar. It is tentatively only available at retailers or partners selected by Wal-Mart. Ordinary users can exchange US dollar cash at designated institutions. It is similar to a prepaid card in a system, but it can generate interest, and a credit derivation function may appear in the future.

## Currency type
The types of stablecoins on the market are mainly divided into:
1. Single legal currency mortgage stable currency: Digital goods based on blockchain, led by Tether, but without the "price fluctuation" of the US dollar. Latecomers such as USDCoin, TrueUSD, etc.; multiple legal currency collateralized stablecoins have improved the transparency of business models.
2. Digital asset mortgage: such as DAI and BitUSD, stablecoins issued with over-mortgage of native assets on the blockchain are still anchored to USD.
3. Physical mortgage type: DGX, etc., use gold as collateral to pursue the stability of gold prices.
4. Non-collateralized algorithm type: Basis, Ampleforth, etc. hope to control the balance of supply and demand of currency through algorithms to achieve stability, but this concept is difficult to achieve.
5. Debt/Equity Type: JP. Morgan’s JPMCoin is similar to the traditional bank’s derivation of credit currency.

## Vision status
Libra's vision is to be a global digital native currency that integrates stability, low inflation, universal acceptance and interchangeability, promotes financial inclusion, and focuses on payments and cross-border remittances.

Libra has the potential to open up to Facebook's existing 2.4 billion user base, prompting them to use Libra tokens for transactions worldwide. Facebook will have the opportunity to change the current situation of monetization methods that rely too much on advertising (98.5%), and further enhance its position as a provider of digital APP, digital website and e-commerce open source tools.

## social influence
As a cryptocurrency beyond sovereignty that conforms to the characteristics of the Internet era, it will inevitably have an immeasurable and huge impact on monetary policy, financial supervision, financial security, the world currency pattern, and even the international political and economic competition pattern.

Representative Maxine Waters, chairman of the U.S. Housing and Urban Affairs Commission, previously called on Facebook to suspend work on Libra until Congress and regulators have the opportunity to carefully review the proposal. Maxine Waters said in a letter to McHenry, a Republican colleague, that Facebook should stop the development of the Libra network until a hearing. She believes that as Facebook announced the creation of a cryptocurrency, its unrestricted expansion and plans to cover it The scope extends to the lives of its users. However, there is no clear regulatory framework for cryptocurrency to provide strong protection for investors, consumers and the economy.

McHenry responded that there are many unresolved issues regarding the scope and scale of the project and how it complies with our global financial regulatory framework. As policy makers, we have a responsibility to understand the Libra project. We need to go beyond rumors and speculation, and provide a forum to evaluate the project and its potentially huge impact on the global financial system.

### "Libra" have at least three influences:
1. Reshape the payment industry: a new group of players will build a new stage in the digital world. There is currently a long-standing debate, that is, "Who will eventually become the key financial service provider in the mobile market?" The Libra ecosystem may cause these debates to become obsolete, directly grabbing the jobs of most financial intermediaries. .
2. Reduce the capital control capabilities of some sovereign governments and affect the currency sovereign status of emerging market countries. As a basket of international currencies and financial assets, the cryptocurrency Libra has the potential to assist companies and individuals to go to the safe harbor of funds ("funds escape safely"). Some channels and markets will use Libra as the denominated currency, which may break the central bank's monetary policy based on capital controls, especially in emerging market countries where capital accounts have not yet been fully opened. Stablecoins and encrypted assets also play this role in some countries. In some countries that adopt capital controls, the spread between the exchange rate of digital currency exchanges and the official exchange rate can illustrate this point.
3. It may strengthen the dominance of the US dollar and squeeze the space for the internationalization of the RMB. Because the U.S. dollar is the most demanded high-credit currency in international trade, investment, and reserves, and measured data shows that the U.S. dollar has the lowest inflation volatility in the past 50 years, that is, it has the most stable purchasing power. At present, the digital currencies issued by most commercial institutions are essentially borrowing the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar. If these digital currencies are widely used, it will squeeze the space for the internationalization of the RMB.

## Regulatory recommendations
"Libra" can only develop in an orderly manner under the regulatory framework of the government's legal compliance. The specific recommendations are as follows:
1. it is recommended that the central government establish the core strategic position of the blockchain industry and digital stablecoins in the future financial system.
2. it is recommended to establish a regulatory sandbox mechanism within a certain range, and pilot payment and settlement services based on digital stable coins.
3. it is recommended to allow private companies to issue digital stable coins and develop cross-border payment and settlement systems.
